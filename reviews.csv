Wanted to get rembushed for different in cost. Been out of pocket over this last time so I didnt't want excuses but live chat staff tried to end my chat twice and was passed onto a manager who tried to end it as well with excuses. Each case is looked into and wasn't accepted for a refund. I'm £3.75 out of pocket.,2021-04-09 16:55,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606cd01df85d7508704c27da,606ccfe826bd26001b4410a6,"Scam! Charged multiple times for missing items, refused a refund","SCAM - I am surprised they are still allowed to operate! Customer service is terribly poor (at least in Edinburgh, Scotland, though since it's an international company, it's probably the same everywhere). A restaurant (Subway) failed to deliver some items and also delivered wrong items - I was refused a refund, basically paying for food that never arrived. Talking to Deliveroo ""live agents"" feels like talking to a rude chatbot - it looks like they have a system where they will refund you once or twice but will stop refunding after that as if it were the customer's fault that he or she receives an incomplete or wrong order more than twice. I order quite frequently and am a paying ""Deliveroo plus"" subscriber (though after recent experiences I will not be renewing my subscription).The script with ""live agents"" (although ""zombie agents"" would be a more accurate description) usually goes like this:1) I'm sorry to hear that - let me look into it for you.2) Thanks for waiting. I'm sorry for the problems you've had with your order, we will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. We're unable to offer you a refund in this instance.When challenged why they charge for wrong items or items that never arrived, they respond with:1) We review each claim on a case by case basis and have taken all the information you have provided into consideration. Based on the information available, we're unable to offer you a refund.2) I'm sorry that you are unhappy with the resolution, if you would like to discuss this further, please send us an email to [Deliveroo's email address]They claim to contact you by email within 24-48 hours but at least on two separate occasions failed to do so.I strongly encourage other people in the same situation to take LEGAL ACTION against Deliveroo using SMALL CLAIMS COURT or similar courts in your jurisdiction. Being forced to pay for food that never arrived is stealing and would never happen in an actual restaurant - they really are milking it during the lockdown/pandemic when very few alternatives are available and most people can't be bothered spending so much time chasing a huge unresponsive company that steals from people while many are struggling financially due to the pandemic.UNETHICAL AND RUDE!",2021-04-06 21:18,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606ca044f85d7508704bc773,5d89d54c7c6eb177e6857c7b,If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have had previous bad experiences with Deliveroo where they didn't assign drivers for my delivery leading to me waiting for an hour before I call them and I am informed about there being no driver to deliver my food so I have to cancel my order and request a refund, which is only a credit to my Deliveroo account and not a credit to my bank account. Because of this I haven't really been using them. But 2 weeks ago I wanted a pizza so ordered on at 7.20. I had an ETA of 8.05. At 8.15 I called the restaurant and the line was engaged. This went on until 9.00. I had intended on sharing this pizza, with my daughter, but ended up having to make her something. I called Deliveroo at 9.15 and asked to speak to a supervisor when a refund wasn't granted. The supervisor refused and said they had to investigate which would take 72 hours. So at 9.45 I have to bundle my sleeping daughter in the car and go to the McDonald's drive through. While I am there I receive a call and when I ask if it's the pizza delivery guy he hangs up. When we get home at almost 10.00 there's a stone cold pizza outside my door. Deliveroo and all these other fast food delivery services are a joke. In the end my bank did a charge back(which I hope all of the many disgruntled customers are using, because when they refuse you a refund they're hoping we'll just swallow it, but most banks will support you). I think I'm a big softy at heart because after my previous experiences with Deliveroo I kept my account, but on this occasion enough is enough and they've been cancelled. Deliveroo are a massive con, because they charge an average of £5.00 a delivery plus card fee(unless you are a direct debit customer, which is what they are trying to push all of their customers towards), and many of their drivers don't know where they are going even after I have put instructions on how to find me. I have lost count of the amount of times I have been asked to come and collect my food (which I always refuse because the delivery is paid for). Also their customer service isn't very good, as they are based overseas and don't know anything about the local area or how close things are. As when a driver hasn't arrived after 2 hours and the restaurant is less than 2 miles away you would think that they would understand how bad the level of service is, but they don't. MY ADVICE TO ANYONE READING THIS IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND WHEN YOU SEE GET DELIVERY FOR FREE, AVOID AVOID AVOID. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO STRIPE YOU UP TO BECOME A CUSTOMER PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. I WISH WE COULD GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE RESTAURANTS HAD THEIR OWN DRIVERS INSTEAD OF USIBG THESE SERVICES, AS IT'S THE FOOD WE WANT. NOT THE MIDDLEMAN.

After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting (which I sat by the window 10 minutes prior to delivery time so I could watch for them) I  contacted deliveroo through their live chat and was told that she had spoken to the Gold Moon and the food would be with me in 5 mins. So 5 mins later I phoned Gold Moon myself. It seems they travel in a tardis to make their deliveries. I was told by a very rude and unhelpful man that the driver had in that 5 mins drove to my address, tried to contact me, then drove back to the restaurant and explained what had happened before I rang. Quite a miracle as its a 15 min round trip.I contacted deliveroo by email and attached screenshots of all communication and call logs which quite clearly prove the driver could never have been here. The next day I called deliveroo who were about as useful as a chocolate tea pot. The woman I spoke to had no interest in trying to help and just kept banging on about having to speak to the restaurant as they did their own deliveries. They needed to ask whether the food had been delivered according to them. Well of course they're going to say it has you dozy mare! And surprise surprise I received an email saying the restaurant had confirmed they had tried and therefore I wasn't entitled to a refund.Turns out the place has a reputation for taking payments and not delivering the I've since found out when I googled them. There are many reviews saying the same thing. In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the rating before I ordered. Then again you wouldn't expect a company as big as deliveroo to allow scamming, thieving businesses to trade through them.Anyway I contacted my bank and disputed the payment and got my money back.

This is below their costs, and means they’re actually loosing money to work with Deliveroo, who have so far refused to deal with them and even suspended their account for complaining. Looking on the internet there are various articles showing this is not an isolated case by some rogue employees or a coding error, but their actual business model during the pandemic. Whilst they know that many restaurants have no other route to market and are desperate, they’re just charging very high commission rates, knowing full well these companies are on their knees and unable to fight back. Without these partner companies, Deliveroo is nothing but this is how they treat them during a national crisis. And it gets worse, they also regularly see which restaurants are most successful in a given area and copy their menu with minor tweaks operating out of industrial units with their own ""exclusive brands"", so they can steal their market share as well as charge high levels of commission. Clearly this is to try and bolster profits prior to their up-coming IPO, but at what cost, effectively extorting small businesses who cannot fight back, absolutely disgusting and predatory. And reading other reviews here, I guess unsurprisingly they treat the riders poorly too.I've cancelled my premium account today and deleted the app and shown this to everyone I know, this kind of abusive way of running businesses makes me sick and I want no part of it.

She then told me that she would refund me £5.99 so I could re-order it, however I let her know £5.99 would cover the food but not delivery and service which I had already paid for initially when I ordered the food, so I wouldn’t be able to get it delivered for that price.After 5 minutes of arguing with me, she said she’ll speak to someone and put me on hold again for a few minutes, and then told me she could refund the delivery fee but not the service fee, I told her this is still unacceptable since I still would not be able to get the food delivered for that price.I then asked her why she couldn’t call the delivery driver and ask him if he could deliver the food if he still had it and she told me that it’s been 20 minutes now and the food would be bad quality. Which was terrible because the food that was sitting on the table had been there for 20 minutes while I was on the phone with her. If she had come up with that resolution in the first place when I had called her, it would have been good quality food and arrived a minute later than expected.The reason I got so annoyed in the first place is that I  only ordered from Pizza Hut for the nachos, the rest of it I didn’t care about that much. I would’ve ordered elsewhere if I knew I wouldn’t get the nachos.Overall very dissatisfied with the service, not only did I not get the nachos, I didn’t get the bare minimum refund so I could re-order them. Honestly after the inconvenience you would expect a good will gesture not an argument.Regards,Sean",2021-03-26 10:59,{1: 'Bad'}

They didn‘t look left nor right and kept on cycling wherever they want. I get the drivers want to be as fast as possible and are under time pressure, but it‘s a huge safety hazard because the cyclist usually come out of the middle of nowhere, they are quick and usually don‘t even see or watch out for pedestrians. For the service: ordered twice, the drivers were always friendly and thankful about tips. Once though we waited for four hours because the delivery vehicle broke down and they had to place a new order. That was a bummer, but the food was worth it. And to be fair, a competent Asian woman immediately called and there was transparency, but I‘d rather this did not happen. I would get a Deliveroo subscription, because they do have more restaurants than Justeat. My main concern though are the cyclists who don‘t care for human lives.

Last night was the last straw. We ordered food at 7p.m. and the deliveroo app gave us one hour waiting time. Which then stretched to almost 3 hours. The last notification I've received from deliveroo was saying that ""Alex"" was delivering our food at 9.50 p. M. After this, Alex went off the tracking system and so my dinner. A huge disappointment. I will never ever ever order with deliveroo again. That dinner was supposed to be the highlight of the week for us. Completely ruined by deliveroo.

Why should I pay for that exactly?Then they were hacked... I noticed a strange order appear to a new address, then another order to same place... So I got on the chat and and the call center person gave me 2 options.1: Live with the fact I'll be buying strangers food.2: They would close my account immediately. When asked should I call my credit card to reclaim the amount they had billed me they reluctantly said they would refund me. I guess they didn't want to incur the fees my CC would charge them for a disputed transaction. Oh and if you want to use deliveroo after you need to get a new email address to register with...What I also noticed was in early days they wanted to help with problems, fast forward a few years and when you discover chicken in your vegetarian dish they make life difficult. You need to photo the problem, then 24 hours late they complain the photo doesn't clearly show it chicken can you send another zoomed in... yes of cause I kept in in my fridge just in case...

All that wasn't too bad. But what was unacceptable to me was that the server I was speaking to disconnected the chat while I was still in it. I was not unresponsive for a long time. In fact, they had disconnected the minute they sent the last message. Even if they were to disconnect, they should have sent a message saying they were going to. Live customer service chats aren't innovative to Deliveroo. How come other companies, whether it'd be internet providers, phone companies, online shopping sites, have managed to use live chats successfully but not Deliveroo?Upon reaching out through email I was also ignored until now. They wasted no time in sending promotional emails during that time though. Obviously, you can tell what's important to them. And I trust that the delay is not because they haven't had time to reply but because they straight up don't care what concerns I'm having.Anyway, 9 days later I never got a refund or email confirmation. So of course, I contacted their live chat again. I was told that the refund had actually been added to my account as credit but that they will redirect it to my bank account.I didn't know such poor customer service still existed nowadays as I had been using other services.This all happened during their $1 delivery promo and now I know why they needed it.Lesson: don't expect much from cheap things.",2021-03-15 08:46,{1: 'Bad'}

What makes me mad is why accept the order. Two emails saying we will not refund you as they think i am lying about this.

Absolutely not. Do they try to resolve the issue? Nope just offer a generic apology and take your money. Now they’re telling me to email support to get my money back after get another order with missing items as they’re unable to refund me. Why can’t supermarkets mark items as out of stock so I’m not charged for them? Why don’t the drivers check if all items are there before leaving the store?

Deliveroo,60463132f85d750394240468,604631031c1cb5001911a9c5,Deliveroo's IPO is going to be interesting...,"Based on my recent experience with Deliveroo it feels like a company in real trouble desperately trying to make the numbers stack up for their IPO. I have used Deliveroo a lot over lockdown, and have happily paid for their Deliveroo Plus subscription for the last six months or so.The service was generally pretty good, but occasionally things go wrong. That's fine, I understand that. They were generally pretty good at fixing things when they did - until recently.I had a series of orders go wrong: one driver claimed not to be able to find my building, and claimed he had called me, and just disappeared with £50+ of curry. Another driver delivered a £20 order to an entirely different building. ""OK, sure, whatever,"" I thought. ""Not a big issue, as when this sort of stuff happens Deliveroo are good at sorting it out.""How wrong can you be? Both times, Deliveroo refused to refund me for these, claiming their T&Cs meant *I* was at fault. After much back and forth I finally got the refunds. That was the point that the warning signs began to appear. Problem is, it's convenient. ""I'll give them another chance,"" I thought. BAD IDEA. Things have gone from bad to worse.The final straw was when I ordered some groceries from the Coop - everything came except a £3 box of blueberries. Fine, no problem. I reported it as missing in the app - previously when something similar had happened (some salmon missing) I reported it in the app and they simply corrected the amount billed to my card. Not this time: I got an email telling me that they were not going to refund me for this. No reason why. I queried this. Still no reason given. I told them that I was insisting in on a refund and would not give up.I then got an email from one of their customer service reps threatening to terminate my Deliveroo Account and implying that I'd previously made fraudulent claims. Interesting, given that *every single time* I had an issue I sent them photographs and they refunded me without quibbling, until the past few weeks. I told them that if they were going to allege I was breaching their T&Cs they should send me that evidence - and if they could not, I expected the £3 refund within 72 hours. £3 refund came through.Now, obviously I wasted WAY more than £3 of my time on this. But the thing is, why should a company promise to deliver something, bill you on that basis - and then when they don't send something they promised, claim that you should still be billed in full? That makes me really furious. First time it was £50 of curry, second time it was £20 of wine, third time it was £3 of blueberries. I can understand the £50 hit - no company wants to have lots of those. But £3 of blueberries: that's the price they put on my loyalty as a long standing, moderately high-spending customer, and clearly that's what their brand equity is worth.£3.Pathetic.I'm assuming this is them trying to tighten things up in the run up to their IPO, and the customer service team have been told to aggressively dispute everything to increase revenue. Doesn't bode well for the post-IPO status of the company if they have to use dishonest tactics like this in order to protect revenues.It'll be interesting to see what price the stock floats at - as it will surely be hugely overvalued based on this. You can be aggressive with your customers for a couple of months, but when you absolutely destroy customer trust and loyalty the business is built in shakey foundations.I've now cancelled my Deliveroo Plus membership and will move my spend elsewhere.",2021-03-08 14:14,{1: 'Bad'}

It's sole purpose is to squeeze money from you by operating close to boundaries of the law. Probably breaking the law 99% of the time because they mislead you on order time a lot of the time. It's Friday, they are short on riders but inform you of usual 20min delivery time from local KFC on the app (which now I know it's not true)... but really they know they can't achieve this and delivery would take more than an hour or more. On this occasion they have already taken nearly 2 hours. I am still waiting. I wanted to cancel but they are refusing to refund because apparently KFC is already prepping my order.It's like dealing with a dodgy street market seller. That's very much their business not to mention how they mistreat their workers paying them next to nothing.My GF and I have probably ordered on 3 occasions with Deliveripoo on a Friday... and always they fail. After two fails, we should have known better... we placed the order at 6.45pm thinking we missed the queue, it's now 8.45pm.... and Deliveripoo have extended delivery time by another 10mins for the 11th time...

I go on live chat and ask them to cancel the order and they say they can't because KFC already has my order.I ask them what to do about the extra £10 I've just been charged and they flat out refuse to help - I have a joint bank account with my wife and apparantly she's ordered using her own card before, which means my deliveroo account and hers are judged to be the same account.Tried explaining that we weren't notified of any stipulations with the order not being able to use a bank account that's been used before, and that if I was really doing this to scam a tenner I wouldn't be asking for the order to be cancelled completely, but the agent kept trying to terminate the chat after not getting a response every 30 seconds.Couldn't even reject the delivery at the door as the doorbell rang, and as soon as I got to it the driver was already in his car driving away. To cap it off, food was stone cold and had items missing. No one would willingly pay nearly £40 for a KFC for 3 people, let alone one that was freezing. Going to open a claim with the bank and won't use deliveroo again. Crap service at unreasonable prices, Just Eat isn't much better service wise but is a hell of a lot cheaper for the same food!Also, check through the other reviews, this isn't the first time they've screwed over customers with promo codes.

Deliveroo, a refund is when a company returns the money a customer has spent with them directly to that customer, because the service or goods that were purchased were either unavailable at source, defective, incorrect at delivery, or simply didn't arrive.It is illegal in the UK to withhold a refund from customers with a genuine reason and argument in favour of having their money returned. The payment should be returned directly to the customer using the method they paid with, i.e. credit card, cash, debit card or bank transfer, or whichever method the client chooses, within 14 days of the initial transaction.

An hour after the estimated delivery time had been and gone and there was still no sign of the food (the restaurant refused to answer the phone), we managed to get through to Deliveroo's customer service. We requested a refund for the meal, which the Deliveroo employee agreed to. During this conversation, the order updated to say that it had been delivered - it had not. By this point it was so late in the evening that we ordered another meal, which arrived on time. Cut to the present; since then (nearly 2 weeks ago now) I've been in a very long email battle to receive compensation for that disastrous first order. Despite providing them with screenshots of the conversation that I'd had with the Deliveroo employee that evening, I've been refused any form of compensation beyond ""we're sorry that happened to you"".I have been told that ""the restaurant uses their own riders and you would have been notified of this at checkout"". Even if you're a Plus member a ""service fee"" is still taken for Deliveroo - surely then you have responsibilities to provide said service? I have also been told no on the grounds of the restaurant's delivery confirmation - hard to prove otherwise but a blatant and total dismissal of my complaint versus the restaurant providing false information (even when captured in screenshots)? I've argued my case, but have been refused multiple times.Honestly? I personally despise confrontation and have never in my life left a public review like this, but the treatment I've experienced as a long-standing Deliveroo Plus customer is shocking.As of today, I've cancelled my subscription.",2021-02-22 12:11,{1: 'Bad'}

Customer services on Live chat stated that they can't do anything else in this case and to email support, not what you want to hear after intentionally ordering food as your busy and do not be inconvenienced with cooking instead I find myself on the phone line which is screeching loud as can be and providing my email for a solution, Lady was very decent but still her decency isn't what's under review here, it's the company that is. (Spoke to Tacobell too the guy literally said Deliveroo are lying if they are saying they cant do anything.)Time before this was shocking, the lid had popped off the curry it had spilt everywhere we initially got offered a refund which we could only spend with Deliveroo again no solution to a meal that we actually wanted to eat in the moment. And the other time we ordered a food shop which had items missing we ordered it so we didn't need to the shops because of Corona Virus but yeah had to go down anyways to grab the missing items. One was a key ingredient to a meal so... I get none of this is ""The end of the world"" but if we think about why we get a take away...- minimize inconvenience - instant satisfaction- because your hungry at the time Not one of these boxes are ticked messing up 3/5 times is not okay and when you take in mind the inconvenience of having to complain... Call up the phone number... and the time you actually spend on the phone with them if you actually value your time and your experiences it just really doesn't sit well.

Deliveroo,602c41e0679d9708b4d89053,602c4153b1558c001aad0e5b,Deliveroo are running a big scam be careful with bad customer service,"For the past few month deliveroo has been taking £11.49 from my account for no reason and when I ask them why, they aren’t even able to give me a reason for this transaction ? At first i contacted them last month after i noticed theweird transaction. When i first contacted the customer service he had the audacity to tell me they didn’t take anything. Even though i have the proof in my bank statement it made absolutely no sense. But since i was busy i decided to just wait and see if they would dare do this again in January. And of course like the shameless scammers that they are; they did ! So this time i emailed customer service again, but this time i was not going to let them play with me, i pulled up with receipts, screenshots, everything. At first they kept asking me for the same documents again and again, i think it was to make me lose my time so i would give up, little do they know i am unemployed i will get my £11.49, i don’t have anything better to do. So i kept sending the receipts they were asking + the one they asked previously to make sure they couldn’t ask it again. Eventually all the documents had been given, but of course the scammers still found a way to delay it by asking me if the transaction was still showing in my bank app? Now i have heard a lot of stupid questions in my days but if you haven’t refunded me my money and you have screenshots of the transaction AND official transaction receipt, how in god’s name fo you expect the transaction to be gone? Again i gave them all the information they needed but they’ve been taking their sweet time . As i am writing this review i still didn’t get my refund. I looked around the internet to see what people thought about this big joke of a delivery service. And online i found so many people complaining of the exact same thing : -taking money for no reason -horrendous customer service So my question is: if we are all being scammed by deliveroo, why are we allowing this to happen ? I’m not the first one that get scammed by deliveroo and then receive horrible costumer service in response (clearly  just people trying to make you waste time and think you’re an gullible idiot ) so we should do something about this. Are you guys trying to sue ? I feel like we deserve reparation for the emotional damage deliveroo has caused and they should be charged with fraud. I am ready to fight deliveroo, i will get my £11.49 or die trying. Don’t play with me in the middle of a pandemic, i’m broke and i have time, it’s a bad combo deliveroo! The only reason i put one star is because i can’t put 0. So if you’re thinking of creating a deliveroo account it’s not worth it, they will steal your money mess up your order and when you try to complain you’ll be met with extreme incompetence. Use Uber Eats instead they are real ones, they might mess up some times but their customer service is bomb!",2021-02-16 22:06,{1: 'Bad'}

Now Deliveroo is refusing to issue the refund claiming they cannot reach the restaurant to verify this. They squarely blamed me for ordering from a restaurant that does its own delivery.

Called Deliveroo to complain and ask for 3 more pizzas to be delivered so that these amazing volunteers don't go hungry - 'sorry, we can't. We need to investigate first and this can take up to 48 hours.' So when asked if these 3 volunteers were going to be left hungry because they refused to authorise 3 pizzas, there was no useful response.  Deliveroo - you can afford 3 pizzas whilst you do your investigations.  Especially for people who are coming out in the freezing cold to help others during this very difficult time.  To say I am appalled and disgusted is a HUGE understatement. You need to review your bureaucratic processes and learn to do the right thing.

Not much use when you’re hungry. I checked the app the next morning and saw a credit for the pizza was there - I’d received no email, message, etc to let me know this.So I spoke to someone on live chat and requested a credit for the redundant pizza dip too. I was told that as that was not damaged, they would not offer credit. That person then cut me off and another came on. I said to this person that if they wouldn’t credit me the dip then I wanted a refund for the pizza instead as would not be using Deliveroo again. This person said they would’ve have redelivered another pizza that night so wouldn’t credit dip. When I advised the app message said a 2 day response time, his reaction was ‘oh’ - he then processed me a refund rather than a credit.Seems crazy to lose a regular customer over £1.50.

I made my first ever account with Deliveroo after finding they delivered in my area and used my boyfriends card with his permission to order a Nando’s after a tiring day. I applied my discount for £10 off £15 and processed the payment on the order screen, an error message came up mid way through advised that I did not meet the criteria for the promo code and that it was being removed, at this point you be expected to be redirected to the payment screen to review the new payment and then proceed just to make sure you can confirm and agree that price? WRONG! It bumped the price up by £10 mid transaction and took more than originally quoted on the payment screen. I tried to cancel, it would not allow me to cancel. I called to speak to someone who just referred me back to T&C’s which did not help, I asked her if I can cancel and she simply said “no” and the reason I wasn’t able to use the discount is because the card I used has been used on a Deliveroo order before, 4 years ago my partner ordered a McDonald’s at work and used his card to pay for it. I appreciate on that basis the card was recognised as a prior card used on their system making me ineligible for the discount, but I expected once the error message flagged up advising I wasn’t eligible it would cancel the transaction and let me check my order as I didn’t consent to that price.Complaint reviewed by Sheila who referred me to T&C’s again as to why I wasn’t eligible, even though that isn’t the issue. The issue is an unauthorised payment being taken from the account!I then spoke to a manager who explained that they cannot issue me a refund of £10 as I did not print screen the order showing £19.64 which why would I?

We recieved a call at 8:43 (possibly from the rider) who perhaps could not hear us, although we could hear noise from his side. We called back but there was no answer. We went outside our flat during this cold rainy night and stood outside for 5 minutes thinking the rider may be lost. But there was no sign of him.We came back up to our flat and checked status online which said the food was delivered at 8:40pm. Bizzare and fraustrated, we called Deliveroo. After waiting 15 mins for someone to pick up, a representative picked up. She initially tried to help and spoke to the driver, who told her that he was sent to a wrong address and no one picked up his call. And that he made way to his second delivery. I kept my calm, until the representative (who sounded like reading scripted lines) tried to get me to order again as last order appeared to be ""delivered"". But, the restautant closed by then. She kept repeating the same thing when my simply question was: why did the rider lie that he delivered the food? and why did he not try to contact us for the second time or even try to simply use google map to find our flat. We placed order using web browser and not the app, and it is not the customer's fault that Deliveroo's web browser does not allow for pin drops like the app! The representative first tried to place the blame on us although our address was perfectly written on the order. After staying on call for 20 minutes, she just told me that she and the company is ""sorry"" for the inconvinience. There was no offer to redirect the order and by the time I left the phone it was too late to order from any other shops. Because of deliveroo, our friday night has been ruined.

I told the customer service again that this is not acceptable and demanded to be refunded which they did at the end after talking to their senior manager.

I had been using Deliveroo for around a year and until this point had no reason to raise a complaint even if the service or delivered food was less than perfect.Firstly when I described the abundantly obvious problem it was clear I was talking to an automated bot for the first five minutes.  Canned responses.  Fine.  Eventually I got through to a person.  In summary these are the reasons for a 1* review:1.  The chat was ended four times by the assistants whilst I was typing answers to their questions, so I had to start again.  Eventually committing 35mins of my life to this but felt I was a the point of not return!2.  I had no response in over 24 hours to my complaint.  3.  Worst of all the last assistant seemed to be doing her best to patronise and downplay before telling me my problem doesn't fall into their refund policy.  If it didn't then what on Earth does?I didn't need a full refund.  All I wanted was a gesture and I would have forgotten it and ordered again the next day.  @Deliveroo....this tells me....your people are not good enough.

Even though I had an account with deliveroo I never used them due to cost. I favoured Just Eat. Just Eat, though, started delivering very unreliably so I decided to try Deliveroo. My first order with them was on 19th November and then I had 10 more orders with them. During that time period I never contacted them in any shape way or form other than for the delivery order. However, I was happy with their service and started trialing premium membership. I'm front line NHS worker and things were tough a week at the hospital so I was relying on delivered food. On the 9th of Jan I had my 11th order with Deliveroo but my card payment kept being declined. I thought the bank blocked my account and so I contacted them and they told me it had nothing to do with them, they had approved the payment and the error was with Deliveroo and to contact them. Then I entered the twilight zone. As I came to find out Deliveroo has no direct number and you can only contact via chat. Via chat they told me they would look into it and they would get back to me via email within 2 working days. I said this was not resolving my problem as I needed to order food then and why was I paying for premium membership. They said they would look into it. Again then they said they would get back to me via email in 2 working days. I said I was unhappy with this and I would cancel my membership, which I did. Thank the gods that happened to be just in time of the trial period so I never paid them the extra membership money. I then forgot about them as I saw customer service was non existent and went happily about my life. I also did not hear back from them within working days but I could also care less. Until today. Today they sent me the email attached below. Given that I never asked them for a refund and have never contacted them in the past to compliment, complaint, or even on error, I find this to be a highly harassing email from a service I had already let go.

Deliveroo,600ec637679d97067cf9a5a2,56fe3fce0000ff000a1382e2,Appalled by today’s service.,"Appalled by today’s service. I ordered food for some family members who have COVID with their mom admitted in intensive care and dad too ill to cook for their 3 children (all under 18 with the youngest one 5 and the middle one with learning difficulties). Between order and delivery, it took 2 hours. I ordered well in advance so they will have food in time but this was not the case. I’m sure we all know how angry, grumpy and sad being hungry makes us, so imagine how a child will feel. No child should have to wait for their food, we’re not asking for charity! Deliveroo proposed around £6 credit to my account for this. Money won’t change anything but it, of course, definitely helps. I requested Deliveroo to either provide more credit or 50% the next order as I will need to order for their food until their mom comes back (I don’t live near them otherwise I would have made and delivered the food myself). I made this request on the basis that Deliveroo is always giving its customers random discount etc. And surely this wouldn’t have put them out of pocket but this would have been regarded as a nice gesture. I use Deliveroo quite often, but this is the last time I’ll be using Deliveroo. So utterly disappointed.",2021-01-25 13:23,{1: 'Bad'}

They thought it perfectly acceptable to refund the rice and I could eat a curry without. My daughter and I ordered a meal on Saturday from a new outlet. The meal arrived over 30 minutes after expected time. The containers were on their side, liquid had spilt over all contents. The food was lukewarm and not our order. We rang deliveroo to be told we would be credited with the cost of the meal. There is never any offer of compensation. We were left without a meal.

Firstly it’s actually cheaper if you order through the restaurant directly via their own website/phone. Secondly the customer service from deliveroo is SHOCKING. I ordered from them for the first time when I was 10 weeks pregnant. The food I got came fast and on time, however two of the dishes weren’t as they should have been. I know this isn’t deliveroos fault so I contacted the restaurant directly and they were really apologetic but said because I ordered through deliveroo I needed to peruse it through deliveroo. If I ordered from them directly they would have been able to sort directly for me. So I called the helpline for deliveroo and was told due to the circumstance the food was not acceptable, they would happily arrange a refund for the two (out of five) items i ordered. It was confirmed with a supervisor and I was told I’d receive an email within 5 working days regarding a refund. No email, so I contacted them again. They gave me an email to send to and apologised. No reply for two weeks. Once a reply was received they said they apologised for the wait and was forwarding my query to the relevant person(s). Again no response after that so I emailed again and again. A month later I receive an email from Starlet saying no refund would be processed and no reason why. Just a short blunt email. So I asked: why? I’ve been told I could get a refund, the restaurant was on board? To that, just another blunt email ‘we’ll use your experience for future reference’ This is absolutely by far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Firstly recieving food that was off while I’m pregnant and having to throw the food away because I don’t want to risk the health of my unborn baby - which the restaurant has taken responsibility for and said they’d refund the money through deliveroo - but mostly because of the disgusting service from deliveroo. Don’t bother using them, waste of money and time. They don’t care, they’re rude and they lie. Oh, and they charge more than restaurant prices too.

So you're literally asking for it.Here's a couple of suggestions to make the experience better: 1. Stop putting members of my community at risk 2. Acknowledge and respond to requests for basic hygiene and health policy information3. Facilitate the delivery of the correct food order and ensure that food is warm (one job, et al)4. Respond to complaints with customer service, not with an automated droid5. If you do have to use an automated droid then don't try and hide it6. Serious complaints team should try and acknowledge the actual complaint 7. Serious complaints team should avoid calling me 'Starlett' when responding to the serious complaint - the name of your automated droid8. Respond to data protection requests and avoid sending surveys to disgruntled customers who have made aforementioned requests. So yea, work on that. It's not that I have a particular problem with the name Starlett - I quite like it. It suits me. It's more the absurdity of it's use when a member of the serious complaints team (SCT) uses it. It is the equivalent of a member of the flying squad on the Sweeny kicking in the door and yelling ""FREEZE!"" then realising he got his service weapon mixed up with a sex toy.The part that makes me smile is that Starlett is the name of the automated droid responding to the customer complaints. So the crack member of the SCT (I am assuming an expert) not only didn't read my complaint, or absorb the most basic information, (like my name) but also didn't know enough about Deliveroids customer relationship management process to recognise the name of the droid they are mugging me off with!This now makes it a member of the Sweeny kicking in a door, service weapon mixed up with a sex toy, realising the door leads to the set of Pat Sharp's Fun House instead of a crime scene.

Deliveroo your behaviour towards customers is abysmal we are the reason you exsist! My review is based on the delivery of 'stone cold' food on New Years Eve for which Deliveroo were the delivery service. We purchased a meal from our local Wagamama and as soon as it arrived it was unpacked/served where we realised it was cold and so I called Wagamama to advise them and they offered either a replacement meal or a refund we went for the latter. Deliveroo customer service have contacted us twice and they signed off by saying ""we'll do better next time""- what next time???? We've asked you to make right on our order and to date you have not we will not use your service ever again and you should look to your competitors as an example of providing a decent level of service to their customers",2021-01-10 19:44,{1: 'Bad'}

We wasn’t contacted via phone call either. Their only solution was to wait another 40 minutes for a re delivery which would have meant a delivery at around 21:30. It was Such a disappointment.  We will not be using deliveroo if we decide to order food In again.

They don't allow you to complain more than once as they consider it a breach of their rules. They deliver cold food almost as a constant and have zero interest in resolving the issues. The drivers are paid a pittance and Deliveroo also rip the restaurants and cafes off by charging them up to 45% of the amount you pay - so they get over half the amount we pay for the takeaway. Let us all try and work with the restaurants and cafes and cut these vile and evil companies out. BTW, the tips you leave for the poor driver is taken by them and they remove a handling charge etc....usual sharp practices and as a multinational company, they also pay zero tax in the UK.

Deliveroo,5fed5671755dc1032c081b59,5fed556476582900197912f2,"Deliveroo service is flawed, thus bad","The Deliveroo delivery service is based upon non-employees taking rides selected by their software to deliver food. Up to this point, it is ok, as it works well in other countries. However, the riders are not properly vetted, trained or accountable for the service they provide.I have lived in two distinct areas of Greater London, one in zone 6 and another in zone 2. The service varies largely. In zone 6, you could say it is just alright. You get your food delivered, well packed and within good time. I only had occasional riders that were too lazy to come to my door and would rather deliver in reception.When I moved to zone 2, it was utterly terrible. 9 out of 10 deliveries had problems. Some were the restaurant's fault with missing or bad items, but most of them were with riders doing a myriad of mistakes up to the point of cancelling deliveries twice in a row!They are occasionally rude and most of the times lazy enough to even take the lift.I understand they have many deliveries and are paid little, but their job has to be fulfilled in full. If they do it correctly, they do not deserve a tip because it is their job. If they do it well enough, they are entitled albeit not required to be tipped.These problems happen and are getting out of hand of that Deliveroo mostly employ illegal immigrants that use borrowed or rented accounts. No vetting is done, and if they do wrong, there is simply no real accountability besides some app restriction towards more work and account cancellation. If they were at least contractors, properly registered and stuff, there would be accountability for their mistakes.Let's be frank here. This is one of the meagre jobs that a lot of people get to live by. I don't want to generalise as some people are genuinely doing good work and are honest, but come on. If you are not legally resident here, you are breaking the law, so can't expect better from these people.I am an immigrant myself, fully registered and legally employed, and think what many riders do is despicable at best.Well, away from my rant, I believe that Deliveroo is responsible for employing such people that do not have proper morals and work ethics. Therefore they deserve this review more than the riders themselves.The downside is that since there is little competition in my borough, I kind of have to suck it up. But certainly, when I move again, I will stop using their services altogether even if it means going for takeaways myself. Making money whatever means necessary is ugly and despicable at best!

It’s such a shame that a few bad delivery riders ruin the reputation of Deliveroo. I will put it down to the driver not the company or restaurant. The worst service I have ever received from a delivery service. I am in Hereford. This is the email I sent to Deliveroo which explains what happened last night. Avoid if you don’t want to be ripped off and treated appallingly. Order 1888/9401Hello,I had a delivery from you yesterday & I received the worst service I have ever received from a delivery company ever. I ordered my food from Pizza Hit order Number 1888 and when the delivery driver left the restaurant I watched him come close to my property but could see he had difficulty locating me. The driver telephoned me and unfortunately despite me & my mother desperately trying to guide him he claimed not to be able to find me. I watched him drive very close to my property but then drive off and the next thing I knew it said on tracker my order had been delivered. I telephoned & spoke to a very nice polite member of your staff who apologised and said he would reorder the food with a different driver order number 9401. I then watched as my order was “prepared” and then left restaurant. Again the driver couldn’t find my property apparently despite my house clearly showing where it was on tracker. I was asked to telephone him which I did and again had problems communicating so I said I would go up the road and find him. It was pouring with rain so I was soaked by the time I returned with my food. When I opened the pizzas & sides you could tell that it was the original order which had been attempted to be reheat. The food was inedible and I had to put the food in the bin. I am so angry as I had family around for Xmas and was treating them to some food. I waited almost 2 hrs for food that was inedible and almost cold. I order regularly from just eat, Uber eats & Deliveroo & I have never had such terrible service and I am not happy. What makes all this worse is I was using a gift voucher from my Mum & Dad to pay for this awful food. I can’t see myself using your service again in the future as you don’t expect to pay over £50 for food, wait for 2 hrs almost and also have to go out and find your driver, getting wet for the trouble. I have always been very happy using your service but you ruined my Xmas get together before we all lock down again. Mark Davies.",2020-12-24 13:32,{1: 'Bad'}

This has happened with another delivery company and they were happy to honour the discount. Why would i choose to put further money into a company to use my discount? If the discount was honoured i would of likely purchased again through them, but now there's no chance.IF YOUR DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PRIORITY, THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL DELIVEROO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2020-12-14 21:20,{1: 'Bad'}

I explained we did not want the pizza anymore and they are not to deliver it. At 22:00 they called to say the pizza was outside . We asked them to go away. We complained to deliveroo , who said we could not get a refund because we did not let them know before hand, which we did. So we have to pay for a meal they delivered 5 hours late . This is all due to deliveroo system crashing and providing no simple capability to cancel the order. Therefore beware if deliveroo have an IT issue the customer is at fault.

Easy enough to order but annoying that all products were inflated in price, plus large delivery charge, service charge of 5% on top plus they want you to tip the driver!! But needs must when you can’t get out of the house. I paid almost £20 for 2 pizzas, some coke, antibacterial wipes, bread & milk!!! Once the order arrived the driver left it on the doorstep for me which I asked in the notes as I was self isolating, which was great!! I noticed they had sent the wrong item. Unable to get hold of anyone from Deliveroo apart from to say an item was incorrect which they refunded into my account to credit.I didn’t want credit as had no intention of using the service again.Emailed 3 times (this was about a month ago now) to say I wanted a refund instead of the credit and never got a reply. Phone lines always busy too! I then got an email saying ‘don’t forget to use your credit before it expires!!’ What an absolute joke!!I gave up and decided I’d use my credit tonight as I’m obviously never gonna get my money back.Ordered a subway, used my credit and put to the rest with my own money. It said order received and money taken out of my bank, delivery would be 20-30 mins. So like 45 mins pass and I look on my orders and see no order there? Money is still out of my bank so I rang subway who hadn’t received the order and was nothing they could do, told me to get hold of Deliveroo.DM’d Deliveroo on Twitter who are just ignoring everyone and still can’t get through on the phone!Horrendous customer service. Safe to say I’ll never be using the service again and I’m not holding my breath for a refund.Sticking with Uber eats!! Please don’t use them it’s daylight robbery, and if they don’t want to refund you they just won’t.

I was very surprised to see that my ordered had a delivered status. We then try to call the customer service. This is the worse customer service I have ever heard. They were not helpful at all. They said to me your food was delivered at that address and we tried to call you on your number. I never received any call, se one the address was clearly mentioned and no one never even bothered to try to ring the bell. One day later, I received the following message from someone named Olivia:Hi ...,As we previously let you know, we are unable to offer you compensation for this order.Honestly this is the worse delivery company.

I decided to give it ago and they checked that on my bank account they decided to charge extra £3.5 for delivery!!! No notification on price change. Just charged with the extra fee!

On Friday evening, 27 November at about 6pm, we ordered a meal from Five Guys which didn't turn up.

I ran down the stairs and while on the doorstep, I received a message to state our order would be left on the doorstep. The only thing on the doorstep was me and no Deliveroo rider or food to be seen. When I rang Customer Service I asked her to speak to the driver. She said she did and that he had definitely rung the intercom. If he was close by he could have come back - it was literally a few minutes after he said he was here. I was offered a re-delivery which we received 15mins later minus all the fries. It was in a bag that had a completely different order ticket on it for a completely different address. When I rang again to complain, I was cut-off. I have since emailed and only received a generic email in response. The difficulty in getting in touch is a sign that they can't cope with all the complaints re their bad service.

This is understandable, it can happen. However, it did kind of ruin our overall meal, and we did expect some sort of compensation. The rep we spoke to offered the menu value of the item *as credit*. I expressed that i thought it would be fair to get 20-30% of the bundle value refunded, as the item was relatively cheap but important for enjoying the more expensive dishes (i.e., it was a dry carb to go with an expensive wet main). The reason i'm giving one star is that 3 times the rep just ended the conversation when i refused to accept the menu value. To be clear, i remained polite and respectful the whole time. I had to re-explain the situation 3 times, which further took away from my Saturday evening. I felt like they were purposefully doing this, which is extremely frustrating.

This is very annoying because the extra 20mins (at least) means that you get your order ice cold. The guy before you paid exactly the same as you, so it's like a lottery. Sometimes you get your order on time, and sometimes ""rider is delivering another order first"" and suddenly you have to wait an extra 20-30mins and you can be sure it's going to be cold. You should be able to accept (before paying) whether you want your delivery guy to deliver other orders first, and should be cheaper, like if you share an Uber.

They checked, admitted fault and were profusely apologetic and advised me to contact Deliveroo to be refunded. I contacted Deliveroo and was quite frankly appalled at the lack of customer care. I couldn't tell whether I was speaking to a human or a robot - the advisor was that robotic. They loosely apologised for the inconvenience but refused a refund. Really Deliveroo?! I called back to speak with another advisor to see if they could assist, but no - the same robotic, useless approach: loose apology and no offer of a refund.I should point out that I have a serious gluten allergy and I could have been admitted to hospital had I ate the food. Clearly Deliveroo think they are above the law and think that an incorrect order when an allergy is involved is acceptable practices. It is not, and is quite frankly dangerous.Deliveroo's approach, or lack thereof, is startling.

A dish on Deliveroo can cost about £4 more than it does direct from the restaurant. Then you've got the delivery fee which can be about £4 and the service charge is up to £2 now. If you take say a £10 burger and chips, it can land up costing you double on Deliveroo!On top of this there's the optional tip for the restaurant (no - you've already tipped yourselves by marking up your prices) AND the optional tip for the delivery driver. I have to say I never ever tip either. I feel bad for the delivery guys because I really don't have anything against them, but once I've paid the mark-up, the delivery fee and the service charge, I just can't do it; I'm not made of money.The 'offers' advertised on the site are also very misleading. I'm constantly seeing 'free delivery' everywhere but what they mean is, if you subscribe to their monthly thing AND spend over £25, THEN delivery is free. I don't know who's getting what money exactly but from a customer's point of view I feel it's kind of a rip-off.

Then, 3 days later, I get told I will be refunded only for the amount of the missing item. Useless as I had to order another take away and therefore the whole order should have been refunded. Also this refund will take another 5-10 days to arrive. So I’m out of pocket forever and even the tiny refund may not arrive until 2 weeks after my order.

I have had one instance where they didn't refund me for a case where they should have, but the rest of my interactions with them has made up for it.The last place I lived was not properly registered on maps, which made getting drivers to my door a ball ache. Every single time I had to contact them to say their GPS had taken them on the wrong road. It wasn't their fault, it was the landlord's fault for not registering the address properly. Unfortunately, most of the drivers didn't have a good grasp of English so the language barrier made this communication harder. I'm pretty sure one driver even had a panic attack, as after 20 minutes of trying to explain to them, they turned up to my door with an entourage of Deliveroo drivers holding their hand. I'm not joking, a literal Deliveroo convoy of 2 bikes and a car. I live somewhere much better now, and every delivery has been smooth as butter.While there seems to be some legitimate complaints in other reviews, trust me when I say 95% of them are from people who don't have 2 braincells to rub together.

Fair enough- it happens, but I wasn’t able to get in contact with them to let them know this is the case. I am happy with them bringing it to me later or refunding money to my bank account (and not a deliveroo credit).I don’t want to seem harsh, but it wasn’t like after over an hour of waiting for these few products from coop that they couldn’t have double checked that everything was there.

The person on the end of the online chat was abrupt and clearly just wanted to get rid of me, and tried twice to leave the chat even though I was still asking questions.I had raised a complaint to follow this with them, and despite an automatic response that they would respond within 24 hours I have heard nothing since (4 days later).I do not intend to use their service again.

When I tried to enquire it then took a further 45 mins with chat/calls with Wagamama blaming Deliveroo and vice Versa.

Deliveroo,5fa59f505e693f0acce1c8dd,5fa59f32d550110019a1b7d8,I have just had a very bad experience…,"This is the first negative food review I have felt the need to write as I am an extremely positive individual whom always tries to see both sides of a story and understands that everything can't be perfect right! However I strongly believe that writing this review is a good use of my valuable time to raise awareness amongst others! I have just had a very bad experience with deliveroo. I made an online order for a food delivery (dinner after returning home from a hard day at work lecturing in Health and Social Care during this COVID pandemic on the first day of the second lockdown) and the food I ordered never arrived. However I did receive an email from them stating that the food had arrived. So I made contact with them via their live chat online to discuss. First of all the chat operator stated that the food had been delivered, when I asked why the delivery guy did not ring my doorbell (white doorbell with my name clearly written on in which I stated in my order comments when placing my order) she then changed her comments and stated that actually the driver could not find my address so the food was not actually delivered, therefore he send me a message through the App to let me know. However I have not downloaded the App on to my mobile, I placed my order online via their website on my laptop so I did not see the message they stated that the driver send via the App. Deliveroo stated that I was not going to be given a refund because the driver delivered the food... even though we now know that he didn't because he couldn't find my address. I have written evidence that I screened shot from the live chat which shows the full content of the conversation that I had with the chat operator. I asked to speak with a manager and I asked for a name she stated she couldn't give me one. So I asked for a copy of the complaints policy and she referred me to the website to check out its terms and conditions which I did.  No where in their terms and conditions does it state that if the driver cannot find the address that the food ordered would be referenced/deemed as delivered and that you don't get your money back. I live a few roads away from the restaurant which the food was meant to be coming from. Its not a difficult address to find - infact its a well known address in my area - just of the Wandsworth Bridge Road in Fulham London, a simple house with a door number - on a simple road all clearly signposted with road signs and names... however according to deliveroo the driver could not find it. If the driver had a sat nav or mobile phone that is all that is required for him to find my address, he just needs to punch my postcode into whatever device he has right? and BANG he has my address, but it appears that was too much of a difficult challenge for him to do.  Deliveroo does not make any effort or attempt to direct a lost delivery driver to the right address, you would expect a delivery company to have some sort of procedure in place for that no? a quick chat with a lost driver on his mobile right, but no, that does not happen! You would assume that this would be something that deliveroo staff do to support their delivery drivers from a secure location in front of a computer, anywhere in an office or in someone's living or bedroom at home during lockdown right, as it doesn't seem too be much of a difficult task but they do not do this. So now I have to find the resources within my cupboard to make a last minute quick dinner for my children after a full on day at school for them and a full on day at work for me, children are already in their PJs. I don't want to risk getting them changed from their PJ's into thier day clothing to have to take them outside with me (because they are too young to leave at home alone) to the shops to buy food for dinner on the first day of the second lockdown. Let this be a warning to you all, please think twice about the company you use to deliver your food during lockdowns... it might not ever arrive and when you wonder why and approach the company to challenge why? they will tell you different stories and lie. They are dishonest, and function with the belief that if the driver doesn't know the address than that is an ok excuse to state that the food that has been delivered and use it as an excuse not to give you a refund as if its your fault and not theirs or the drivers who is not sat nav savy. I have all the written evidence from my chat with the online operator which I have screen shot with my mobile phone - I have also approached a well known newspaper to raise my concerns especially after reading all the other reviews on here about the negative experience they had too, very similar to mine. Shame on them!!!!  I will not be using them again. I ordered at 5pm. its now 7.05pm. Still haven't had a dinner and I have a hungry household.",2020-11-06 19:09,{1: 'Bad'}

First time using Deliveroo and definitely won't be using it again. I live in an apartment block with coded gates etc to get in.

I received a notification on the app that my order had arrived but no sign of the driver. I received a message from the driver just saying "" Hello "". I replied with ""I am on the main road beside the gate and gave him/her even more helpful directions"" I was across from a garage so it easy to find me. I waited some more but no delivery. I called the driver twice... no answer. Then all of a sudden, the app notifies me that the driver couldn't contact me and that the food was left at my door. NONE OF WHICH WAS TRUE.

Consequently, Deliveroo were notified of the missing items and  the fact that they had been paid for but not received. It was stated that they would respond within two days, but they never did. Following an email response to their support email address several days later, it was stated (by them)  that  “ We can’t offer you credit right now. We will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. “I then requested to know why a reimbursement could not be made for products that had been paid for, but not received. I  have received two emails in response to those forwarded  previously, at separate intervals, stating that reimbursement could not be made, as a complaint was needful of having been made within two days  of receipt of the order, however, I  reminded them that I had responded immediately on receipt of the order directly via their   contact info on their website, in which I had highlighted the two items which had been omitted from the order.Having then received a reply which reiterated that as I had not made a complaint within a specific two days, then a reimbursement would not be applied, I am therefore of the impression that even though I had responded immediately, then  responses via their recommended website contact process cannot be adequately proved, which is what must have transpired in my  particular case, even though later alternative communications  forwarded by email, appear to be acceptable as  proof of their existence.Do they not have a process for acknowledging and recording customers' responses to missing items following the fast-track recommended contact route from their website?I cannot understand how a supposedly reputable company such as Deliveroo can cheat their customers in this way; failing to provide the goods paid for and then declining a reimbursement.It would be interesting to know how many other customers have been treated in such a shoddy manner.It is also of concern that reputable companies such as Morrison's and shortly Aldi will be placing delivery options in the hands of Deliveroo.Needless to say I have now unsubscribed from Deliveroo and shall never be ordering from them again due to their abysmal attitude to customers.Incidentally, I am in my seventies and a so-called vulnerable person, but still retain the wherewithal to fight my corner, but believe that it is absolutely abhorrent that there will be others, who will be unable to do so.",2020-11-06 15:06,{1: 'Bad'}

To be told that the operator on the phone had already requested a redelivery and couldn’t process the refund. To be clear I asked how long the re-delivery would take and after hearing, I was very clear that I did not want it and only wanted a refund.I was then on hold for the best part of 20 minutes throughout our call while the operator struggled to rectify the error and issue the refund.I was also then told that there would be no additional compensation despite wasting my time and losing complete trust in the service. My view here is this error is entirely down to the deliveroo service and it is not the restaurant's fault.After arranging alternative food, we then get a loud knock/ door bell ringing at our door at a late time with the replacement food delivery. We deliberately didn’t want the redelivery to avoid such loud unexpected noises while our young children had gone to bed.Altogether a poor experience that will lead me to avoid deliveroo in the future and the unhelpful support after the error of no food will leave me with only very poor opinions to share with my friends and colleagues.To top it off - the automated response said they would respond within 24 hours.....

Deliveroo had already hid their customer service number and only provide an email adresse if you wish to complain or need to have a go at them for their not so clever scamming scam.

To cut the long short the driver had gone AWOL so a new driver was found. Deliveroo gave me £2.50 compensation. It is because of how they have dealt with these problems I have awarded them 3 stars.

There are other services that will deal with your disputes more effectively than Deliveroo. They automatically opted me into their monthly subscription of £11.49 last August 2019. As someone who usually buys things online I barely check my bank statements, I only found out last week when I saw a charge for £11.49. I contacted my bank and got that refunded. However, after raising the matter of what I deemed that somebody was using my details which they acquired from Deliveroo, nobody responded. Fast forward to a few days later, I come to know that they have been taking £11.49 for a total of 14 months without my permission! Trying to get into contact with them was a hassle, constantly getting ignored and then came and said they can only ‘compensate’ me 6 months’ worth of refunds. I was confused as to what they meant by ‘compensate’ considering it’s my money they have been taking my account without my consent to sign up for this so called ‘Deliveroo plus’ subscription. Of course, I wasn’t having that. I was still short of £90! I was calling up to their ‘customer service’ line for days on end as they kept telling me to email and that is the only way I can resolve the issue. They persisted that they cannot refund me any more money back. They illegally opted me into a monthly subscription without my consent on an account I had not even used since October 2019. I sent multiple letters to them via email asking them for proof that I had subscribed to Deliveroo Plus and a copy of the emails sent to me (of course I never got any as I never subscribed) and they were unable to provide the proof. THEY EVEN CHANGED THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE SAME DAY I RAISED THE DISPUTE FOR THE CHEEK! Totally illegal and dodgy to opt someone into a monthly subscription when they place one order with you guys. The customer service is none-existent. PLEASE AVOID. Not worth the stress they cause. Also, if they get your order wrong or items are missing, they add the amount as credit form to your Deliveroo account and not refund you the money to your card. Conveniently. Please look up all the complaints from hundreds of people on Twitter, Trust pilot if you want further proof. THE WORST!",2020-10-17 21:11,{1: 'Bad'}

The cheese cake was half like scrambled egg it had obviously took all the heat in the bag. Shame that heat wasn't evident when I got it. Everything was cold. So I phoned the restaurant said I wasn't happy with the quality of the food I paid £20 odd pound for. He came to collect it and was cheeky at the door told me I was wanting his food and money and I won't be receiving a full refund as I wasn't allowing him to amend the order. So I speak to Angel mae on the live chat on just eat and I get a forum explaining that every resteraunt has different ways of making things and unfortunately will not be receiving my money back. No, I was seething by this point. I ordered through just eat as I always do. I order mostly from this shop as its my local and I never complain. I've never asked for a refund in my life with just eat and I have o food to show for my money. So I asked Angel mae for a number to speak to some regaurding this. I get a recording of options I press 2 then 2 again then 3 and I think great I'll be through to someone the now to speak about this terrible order mix up and the recording tells me to query on the problem page and hangs up on my so I'm dialing again cause I'm past hangry now. I press 1 I'm not a business owner but I am sure as the sky is blue having my say. So I get through and I said this is completely unacceptable and rabbit down that phone like I was ready to say heads will roll. I get told I am refunded £18 they aren't refunding me in full cause of charges aren't refundable. There is no talk of a voucher or anything for my wasted time and money. Absolutely disgusting. I ordered my meal at 6ocklock from a 2 minute walk down the road but I'm thinking say safe cause of the virus order in,my food comes over an hour and a half later unedile korma had an oily layer on it was cold, chips were chewy like they had been regeated and the cheesecake like scrambled egg. This was clearly because everything was left in the bag too long. And the way the man spoke to me like don't expect your money back when I am a loyal customer never having a complaint before was despicable. He was acting above me and neither wonder because just eat clearly only care about the business side of things not the customer as I spent most of my night having to fight tooth and nail for my money back and now even still I give my time to try and make people aware not to use this service and go through the distress I have. I haven't even eaten anything since because I was treated like I was stealing my money back. I didn't even get my full money refunded and my bank is not showing the money yet. Please  please do not use just eat they have not got good customer service in place and you could be left with no meal and no refund as the shop will just say contact justeat they have the money and just eat will try to act like your taste buds are the problem. I was 4 hours of my night in total and left with no meal and a word of a refund that I have still to recieve in my bank account. Heads will roll if its not there by the time the full amount I paid goes through. Its still a pending payment to them, so this may correct itself on Monday. But I paid 21 pound odd and only getting 18 odd back so I paid for a night ruined unable to eat from then and we are now at half 2 the next again day. Just unacceptable.

There were many failures with this delivery service. 1. The driver was reluctant to drive to my flat door after I let him in through the security barriers. 2. After being rude to me on the phone whilst at barrier,  he and a female pulled up outside my flat. 3. He did not maintain any social distances and did not have a food bag which drivers usually leave on the floor so the customer can retrieve once they step away. 4. Driver just came over and handed a KFC bag and can of fizzy drink which I was absolutely shocked by. Later I had walked away and entered the flat entrance I discovered that the bag had been ripped in three places and that the food was exposed. The KFC security strip had remained untouched. I have made a complaint to Just Eat and made KFC aware of this issue. However due to being in a pandemic situation I will be contacting  the police and getting advice on steps so this driver cannot do this to other people.

They do not care about making you wait. You will probably die before you get your food. Plus, they will still charge you full price for it! Seeking a tasty meal on valentines for the whole family, my sister ordered an £84 dinner at 17:45. She waited from 17.45 until 20:30 for a driver to be assigned. Heavily frustrated, she used the just eats help chat multiple times, but they repeatedly stated: "" it would be a 15-minute wait to assign a driver"". What a pack of lies. Then, she spoke to Stella Marina, who was incredibly unhelpful (I think my nan could have been of more use and she’s dead). Stella just told my sister to wait for 15 minutes again and again. Abruptly, Stella left the chat and the order changed to delivered. It had never been delivered! We panicked, tried to get an answer to this, but it took them ages to reply to my sister's messages. We felt like we were going to lose our money and get no food. I guess this is how Iran felt when they order tanks from the UK, paid for them, but they never arrived. After two hours and half of waiting and useless chatting, they managed to assign a driver. We asked for money off, but just eats told me as they had assigned a driver, we would lose 50% off if my sister cancelled. That was a kick in the teeth. Sorry, we cannot deliver your order on time, its two and half hours late, plus you are starving, but we will steal half your money and make you stressed. They were not even apologetic. Like a serial killer, they showed no remorse. This placed us in a difficult position. After, two and a half hours our family was starving. We wanted our food. We did not want to lose £40. So, we did not cancel because who wants to lose half their money? In the end, we waited forever for the food and it arrived at five to nine! Funny, as they said it would arrive at 18.10.

I ordered a Pizza Hut delivery Saturday afternoon. After 5 minutes of the order being place, it was marked as collected and on its way. Alarm bells started ringing, as, how could 3 pizzas be built and cooked? I thought that maybe a miracle had occurred and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Nothing arrived after an hour. Contacted Just Eat but got a generic, useless bot through their ""chat"" feature. I then called Pizza Hut who informed me that they wanted to get in touch with me but Just Eat refused to give any contact details (fair enough with the data protection act I suppose), as the Just Eat driver had marked my order as collected and delivered but the driver had not turned up at the restaurant. They asked Just Eat to warn me of this but they didn't. It's now Friday after countless unfuitful chats and calls with agents that can't do anything for you, still no refund, although I have just been informed (after yet another call) that a full refund has been issued. I just have to wait and see if this is true as I have zero faith in this company. This is by far the worst experience I have had with a take away delivery service. So frustrating and disappointing.

The restaurant were unable to assign a delivery driver so the order was cancelled. Just Eat tell me that they have issued an immediate full refund that should arrive back in my account within 20 minutes. That didn't happen. Instead the transaction was debited with my bank and after multiple attempts to chase this up with Just Eat (offering to show them my bank statement to prove this) they simply said ""Your transaction would not be on your statement as when the refund was issued JustEat wouldn't have accepted the payment and therefore would be returned to you. The refund would not show up on any bank statements"". Okay? So why is that order amount debited on my statement? I contacted my bank twice giving them the apparent ""refund reference number"" and HSBC told me twice no such refund was made and JustEat did confirm the payment and had taken it after it was in a pending state. So JustEat are liars, theives and have broken the law. I have began talks with my solicitor in regards to this. I have also had an issue where some of my order was missing and again, was offered a partial refund that never actually showed up in my bank account. This company is a scam. Beware.

Awful customer service","I'm a regular customer and have previously had issues in terms of them resolving sincere customer complaints. Last night I saw that the delivery driver with our order was 'nearby' for a good 20-25 minutes. I assumed they were lost but no one got in touch with me to ask for directions. I then rang just eat to try and make contact with the driver/restaurant. While on hold to just eat i had a missed call from a mobile - when i tried to return the call i was not able and they never rang again. The driver then marked the delivery as 'delivered' even though it had not been. The just eat employee on the phone ( i accept it was not her fault, simply following very poor customer policy) then told me that because it was marked 'delivered' they would need to investigate it which could take up to 48 hours. I asked if there were other options to speak to someone senior in the team - as I now had nothing delivered and was out the money - and was told i could escalate to their manager but that this would take up to 72 hours. Their customer service is horrendous - in spite of being a regular customer I can't rely on getting my money back on an occasion when I received no food. And there is no option to resolve quickly. I'm lucky to be in a position where I could afford to place a new order (this time via deliveroo) but I imagine it would have been awful if it happened to someone who couldn't afford to do so, until the refund had been processed. This is unacceptable. I will be moving to use deliveroo only and will be avoiding just eat.",2021-01-25 09:35,{1: 'Bad'}

I recently got a voucher for JustEat, however, and decided to give them another chance.  What a mistake!  I made an order, albeit to the wrong address, but I ordered 6 hours in advance.  Plenty of time to cancel and make the same order again!  So I called up and asked them to cancel it as I wanted to change the address on it, but wait, the lady on the phone assured me that she was able to change the address on the order and there was no need to cancel and that the order would, indeed, be coming to my address.  Great news!  I was a little nervous though so I contacted them on their online chat about an hour later to ask if the address was really changed on the order.  I was assured for the second time that the address had been updated and that the order should turn up at my address.  So instead of cancelling and reordering, I let them tell me that the address on the order had changed.  6 hrs later, I'm waiting for the order.  It doesn't arrive. It gets marked as delivered. Turns out it still went to the original address.  I don't understand why they bothered telling me that they were able to change the address when they clearly weren't and then wasting my money instead of letting me cancel and reorder it.  What a waste of time.  Then I tried to contact JustEat about this and it went to their ""Investigations Team"", who then emailed me 2 days later with a blank email.  Great.  Contacted JustEat again, and again it went to their Investigations Team.  Now 4 days later (cited to take 2 days) - I've heard nothing from them.  She clearly told me it was passed back to the Investigations Team because she didn't want to deal with me anymore.  Amazing customer service, well done.Edit: Well the timing seems somewhat interesting, I sent them another email and then left this review and then they sent me a refund so I've upped my rating but considering how much hassle this has caused me, it's not going any higher until I see some actual better service",2021-01-14 19:08,{2: 'Poor'}

AVOID!Food not delivered for over an hour after arrival time was sent (well over hour & half after local order), phoned actual restaurant who said no one had collected and ""yes of course food is already cold"" and np idea when it would be delivered!  Then i phoned Just Eat customer service, after first being hung up on before talking to anyone the next assistant said they could not refund me until my delivery arrived and so I must call back when the food arrived if it was cold, which we all already knew it was, and she had no idea when it may be delivered either! Eventually food arrived nearly 2 hours after ordering, driver said he was 2nd driver and had no idea why no one had arrived before. Food was cold obviously.I phoned again and got through to another operator, who hung up on me when he heard it was a complaint!Called again and got a different person again, who spoke entirely from script like a robot, he eventually said that he would refund a maximum of £20. BUT my order was for £35. to start with, let alone any compensatory credit to apologise etc for now being starving over 2 hours later with no food or money back.He repeated and repeated and repeated that he could not refund me and that I could not speak to a supervisor or manager for 72 hours! and that there was no supervisor there at all!Eventually after about 30 minutes, as i would not hang up and held my ground about the theft of my money, he said a supervisor would call back in 10 minutes!  Oh he insisted he was in a call centre in the UK by the way...Surprisingly I did receive a call back & the very friendly woman sounded genuine but still would only give £20 back with £5 as credit to have to spend on scamming Just Eats again so only useable if giving them more money, total scam. She said she could only give £20 back maximum whatever amount an order had cost and they would not refund delivery fees or added costs at all as they had delivered, even though they had failed to collect the food when it was ready and all of the above etc. I could literally hear dogs barking in the background and quite amazingly Cockeralls crowing! - she confirmed that they are based in Asia but couldn't say where because she wasn't allowed and shouldn't be going of script at all, her tone of voice and inflections etc implied that she was exasperated and ashamed of the responses she clearly has had to give a LOT! And the non refunds. Anyway Just Eats have stolen half the cost of my order, not delivered edible food, made me have to spend an hour & half on the phone on 6 seperate phone calls! Wasted 3 hours of my day and meant i couldnt do work i was supposed to do as a result and forced me out into the supermarket for food in the pandemic.Cheers for all that....Great first experience with them.

When I got home, I realsied that the delivery time would be too late to eat. I rang the restaurant to check if they'd started my order, and they hadn't. So I went to JUST EAT www to cancel. However, I was only given two options; to continue or cancel but have half of the cost of the order taken - in this instance it totalled - £18.20. After cancelling, I instantly went onto chat to explain that they weren't justified in taking half the cost as I had checked with the restaurant first. I waited for nearly 90minutes to chat to someone - but the numbers went up and down and then eventually I was told they had closed the chat. I then tried to call their landline, and was sent on a loop to then be cut off - this happened several times that evening, and the next day, and the day after that. I rang the restaurant back, they confirmed that they had received my order on NYE and also said that they would not receive a penny of that 50% cancellation fee. So, this seems a major con, and I would appreciate advice as to how I can report them, as I believe this to be not only extremely bad practice but also scam/fraud-like! I have tried to resolve this with JUST EAT - but they are ignoring me, and each time I go back onto to chat I am told to wait to wait for an email response.

Unfortunately I put the wrong email address on for the lucky recipient (we all love free food and looking down at myself a little too much 🐽) yeah so anyway, my fault, I openly admitted the mistake, so I quickly purchased another and got my magnifying glass out and put the right one on, Great, worked a treat. So I try to contact them via there live chat, again pretty straightforward until drumroll 🥁 🥁 🥁 THEY BOOT ME OFF WHEN I MENTION A REFUND. This happened not once, not twice, not three, not four but five times, five times, again Five times!!! Uno dos tres quatro cinqo. Very rude advisors that swayed from the issue and they took me for a bit of a ride around the just eat roundabout. I gave up on the live chat, headed straight to my best mate resolver, on Xmas day of all days, I get a reply, again they do not understand the issue, that is until I ask for a manager to call me back immediately to resolve. The next day, yes boxing day, at 9am I get a call from just eat. I sharply answered, again the complaints advisor had no idea what had gone on 😭 (will to live lost at this point) , after a further explanation I was promised my refund, within 2 hours of that call, my refund was in my bank. Every advisor I spoke too, promised me the chat transcript from the live chats, not one transcript arrived, I have screenshots after chat 1 because my faith was shot to pieces, and in black and white, 'do you promise to send me the chat transcript after this convo!?' JE 'yes you will receive', chat ends by them booting me as I persist for a manager to enter the chat....... computer says NO, not one chat transcript recieved 🙄. It was a very straightforward query that they turned into a freddy kruger nightmare. I got my money back but I feel that I was very very very lucky to awake from it with my hard earned coin.

Silver linings for Sandra as my craic is second to none.Sandra thanks you justeat, I find you rude, obnoxious, don't listen and very very devious in your ways for a refund. Don't get trapped in the nightmare, call the restaurant up, save yourself the 0.50p service charge and make a new friend like Sandra. 👫Small update. Get signed upto resolver, it's free and you will get your money back as it gets logged with trading standards so they don't have a chicken leg to stand on. Pardon the pun. 🤟",2021-01-02 01:56,{1: 'Bad'}
JustEat,5fefc6b9755dc107e0d4c0e7,5fefc6b4ce9f9700193fbf3d,Legal robbery,More often than not I've had missing items. More often than you can't get hold of Just Eat and when you do they either can't speak English or lie. They promise refunds that you never receive. These type of companies should be illegal because they blame the restaurant who blame them. So the customer runs round in circles and eventually gives up. Someone is getting rich on slave labour and charging customers when no goods are delivered. Will not associate with Just Eat ever again. It's pot luck.

We chose them over Uber Eats due to their lower delivery fees.However this was a big mistake. The App stated a delviery time for 7:12pm which seemd odd at the time, later revised t 7:14pm.When the order was running approx. 20 minuteslate I contacted Just-Eat via the app. I was concerned that the food would turn up cold. Their Cutomer Support team put me on hold and were unable to locate the delivery and they told me to contact them again in 15-20 minutes if the order still hadn't turned up.20 minutes lates I contacted them and they were still unable to locate or contact their driver and offered us a £5 credit on our account which didn't nearly cover the cost of the order. I asked for a full and immeidate refund, we were very hungry and angry at this point. They proceeded to send what can only be described as robotic/scripted responses and certainly didn't come across like tney cared either way. No refund was offered.My boyfriend then contacted them half an hour later. The delivery was now well over an hour late. He asked for a full and immediat refund and was told the order had been ""rejected"" by us! After explaining the above situation (again) we asked for a full investigation & refund as it was clear the driver was not telling the truth and we were still not offered a refund.In the end they told us to wait for an email (no email has been sent a day later as I write this). They also promised an investigation would happen with a decision within 48 hours. When we checked the order later that evening the status on their app had beem updatd to ""delivered at 7.41pm!"".  I then called their Helpdesk at 9.25pm and was able to briefly speak to an agent who was sympathetic but couldn't help and just re-iterated we would have to wait for an ""investigation"".So essentially we have paid for food, it never showed up and now we are currently out of pocket with no expectation of a refund.

He said he would investigate but we would  not get our food, he also said the drivers don't work for just eat they work for KFC so he could not contact the driver to find out where he had delivered our food to, this to me was a ridiculous excuse to give.As  both me and my husband are diabetics we had to have our meal so we jumped in the car and went to the KFC the meal was ordered from. I explained what had happened and the manager phoned Just eat. While she was on the phone the driver turned up and said he delivered the order, I said to him you did not deliver to me or my husband, he agreed to that showed me a photo on his phone where he had delivered to a property in Venmore street which is 3 streets away from me. He said that was where the GPS took him to which means he obviously put the wrong post code in,even a change of just 1 letter can send him to the wrong address. But as my full address was on the bill he should have checked that before handing out food to someone else. I seriously think you should retrain your staff and drivers.KFC however know how to treat their  customers.

And the compensation for deciding effectively taking someone's dinner away fron them is non existant. My wife and I work long hard hours and she cares for her mother. We finally got to sit down at the end of a long day and catch up and share a meal. Our McDonalds was prepared, a driver selected and after waiting half an hour on 2 mcdonalds meals from one mile away, it was reported as being cancelled with no explanation. Just like that. So now Just Eat had decided we were not eating tonight worse still I had to call your customer service line to find out why as if  I was not already owed an explanation. Not good enough. It was at this point it became evident your customers are not important. After failing to carry out the sole service you provide, cancelling 2 tired and hungry peoples dinner that night you could offer nothing but a refund. At that stage and that late in the evening a refund is about as helpful as a delivery company who can't deliver fast food less than 1 mile away in half an hour. To find out the reason for the cancellation only proved to incense further. How can it still be possible that a company of your size and time  in business make it possible, to order from a restaurant that has closed for the night? No warning. No prior checks made. Just a half hour wait and abrupt abandonment of duty of care and service to your customers. And all for my money back. Where does that leave me at 11.30pm on a sunday? Utterly useless. Not only will I not be using this service again but actively advising people steer clear. For a company  that is meant to make ordering food easier, you've proved the opposite and that the best way is go and get it yourself as you can't be trusted.

It is now 72hour after the order and so Just Eat now say ""Take it up with the restaurant"". Just Eat are honestly Useless. Don't waste your money with them They have DISGUSTING Business practices and just mess you around. They allow the restaurants to wait 48hours before ""Completing Orders"" So they don't have to give refunds for awful food and poor service.

Just Eat refuse to contact the restaurant to request that the order is complete.Meanwhile, the App shows the order as delivered at my end... triggered by the restaurant - they’ve deliberately left the order incomplete at their end to avoid providing a refund because they know their service was awful.This loop of death means the restaurant can provide poor service without providing any recompense for dissatisfied customers.At peak times, they can continue taking orders, despite reaching their capacity, knowing full-well that their service will be compromised due to lack of resource and there’s no way for their customers to be refunded.Just Eat, change your process to empower your customers.  This will improve their service experience and ensure people return, making a sustainable model.

Just eat sent me message at 5:22 that food is on it’s way. I kept on waiting till 6 and then tried to contact just eat. There is no one to answer their call and website asked me to contact restaurant. The restaurant told me that I have to speak to just eat as the Food has been ready since 5:15. I kept on trying their number but no luck. I lost hope and went out myself to a nearby restaurant at 6:45 to buy food. As soon as I got home the driver turned up at 7:05. I refused to accept food and asked for refund and it’s a nightmare to claim. First of all chat box tries to resolve your matter for 15 minutes.(just a trick to waste time)Then the customer service person takes over and asks you to repeat your details and story again. And after going through all of that she told me that she can’t give me refund as the driver turned up at my house. Now it will go to some investigation department.(investigation for £18? I think they should contact FBI & MI5) This is clearly another tactic to delay or avoid refund. Any big company refunds straight away to avoid any bad name to their reputation but just eat didn’t even bother. My takeaway was only £18 but I wasted my 30 min just to claim that money.  What a joke. The amount wasn’t significant for me but there are a lot of people who are struggling and for them it can be a big thing. I would suggest you guys never to order through just eat. If you ring restaurant direct your prices will be cheaper as just eat takes certain percentage and you guys are paying for a ridiculous service.

I asked whether the supervisor believed £5 was adequate compensation for 2 hours of my time trying to resolve something that should have taken 2 minutes and the supervisor explained that was the best they could do. Only at this point did they formally cancel my order (more than 24 hours after it had been placed) I requested a callback from someone more senior as I didnt feel my complaint was being taken seriously (the error of their Bot and failure of two 'customer care' operators to deal with my issue) but was warned they couldn't do anything more.Manager called the next day and apologised again for something I had not complained about and offered the £5 credit. Again I asked the same questions and once again, they avoided taking responsibility for their mistake costing me 2 hours of my time to rectify. To ensure my complaint was taken more seriously, I requested a call back from someone more senior.They failed to make that call. I was sent an email to once again apologise for something I had not complained about.Moral of the story, this company seem to be eager to shift the blame onto the restaurants rather than admit to their own shortcomings and then suppress your complaint instead of acknowledging the issue.

Placed an order using the app,the restaurant confirmed the order and gave a 50 min time frame so at 1:03am got a message saying the order was on it's way so I live a 10 minute walk from the restaurant. To meet the time frame estimate should reach me by 1:15am come 1:45am no order so I phoned the restaurant they said the driver was running a bit late and it would be at 2:20,so I said he's not picked the food up yet and the chap said don't worry I've cooked the food I said oh and hung up 5mins later phoned up again and said no cancel the order,it hadn't been delivered in good time so I am entitled to cancel under statutory law. The chap said ok,obviously he wasn't happy but that's not my problem,he told me I'd have to contact just eat for a refund. I contacted them the next day when I got the order number I noticed the app had my order as delivered,I don't know if the restaurant has any interaction with the app as far as marking the order as delivered or not. If they do then they marked it as delivered out of spite. This is where it gets really sketchy I contact customer services first you go through a chat but then the chat but puts you through to an agent while trying to get my refunded and going through the convoluted process I would be dealing with one agent and while I'm typing the agent asks if there's anything else they can do and drops out so I then get bounced onto someone else so you have to start again and control your anger at how long the process is  taking so I left the chat,had a cuppa and phoned them. The person I spoke to had a thick Philippino accent so was abroad and scripted,which they stick to they said the complaint would be handed to their investigation dept and they would get back to me in 48 hours. Of course they didn't back on the chat same rigmarole a little bit more progress,I had to point out that under UK law I'm entitled to my money back and demanded a refund they then inform me they are unable to do so,it would have to go back up the chain and I would have to wait a further 72hours. Every CS agent kept pointing out that the order was marked as delivered,basically calling me a liar. I don't know if the delivered  is applied automatically or the restaurant is responsible but that is not my problem. My contract is with just eat they take the money so I have met my side of the contract just eat is in breach of their contract for not dealing with my complaint and refunding me as swiftly as possible,I can't help but think the whole process is designed to frustrate the customer to the point of writing off the cost. Which in my case it was a grand some of £17.02p in these times which are hard that could feed me for three days so I'm not giving up. If the restaurant did mark my order as delivered then that's not good and just eat need to reprimand the restaurant. Either way just eat has lost me as a customer and I would strongly advise any new customers to try one of the newer apps or deal directly with the takeaway but most of them don't have provisions for automated payments and what with the lurgy cash is not wise. Just eat get half of the one star and the takeaway gets the other half,I get a sore finger and ear and zero respect as a customer from just eat oh and an untitled ticket sent via email,whatever that is and at least I can leave this review as a warning to others avoid just eat like the lurgy and if you do use them eventually,you will end up here and if you have had an identical experience then you know that you are not alone and I'm not a gammon.",2020-10-03 01:51,{1: 'Bad'}

I spent around 40 mins on the chat. The first 2 chat assistants ended the call before it was processed. I had to repeat myself 3 times before I got any joy.  They would not refund the order at the time said the order was out for delivery. I recieved no updates until 10.20pm to say once again the delivery was on its way. When the order came it was cold and not at a satisfactory quality so I refused to except delivery. I informed the assistant on the chat and she offered  a credit note and said it was as good as a refund. No it not. This break the consumer rights and trade description  law. I was given misleading information and the food was at a unsatisfactory standard. Totally unexceptable.

The food took 2 hours 45 minutes to deliver and when it arrived it was cold. I tried to speak with the restaurant (1 successful attempt out of 65) and was fobbed off with an excuse about traffic (even though there was none - food arrived at almost 9pm and roads were empty according to google maps). I spoke to the bot service who put me through to a live chat. I was told just eat can’t help and I need to speak with the restaurant. So I tried the restaurant one more time as requested of me, of course they hung the phone up. I went back to just eat and was told it’s down to the restaurant, they can’t help - even though I had followed every single step asked of me. I then asked for the complaints procedure and was completely ignore, the response was “you need to contact the restaurant”. I then asked again around 10 more times and did not receive an answer as to what their complaints procedure was or given a number/email etc. The service was absolutely shambolic.

I rang Just Eat to find out what was happening, after a long drawn out process I was finally put through to one of their customer service team, I explained what had happened and they told me what I already knew - the restaurant had marked it as delivered - though they also told me an investigation would be launched. A few days later I received an email telling me I would not be receiving a refund as they had checked their records and the restaurant marked it as delivered... I don't know if I need to point out why this is a problem. So a restaurant marks my order as delivered when it wasn't, I call and explain that, their ""investigation"" means simply asking the restaurant again? And what a surprise, the restaurant stuck to their lie. I was frustrated when I didn't receive my food, but I was really getting annoyed now, who wouldn't? Not only am I being refused a refund for food I didn't receive, I'm essentially being accused of lying and Just Eat have not put any effort into determining what is correct - their ""investigation"" is as lazy as they come. So I get in contact with Just eat again and explain all of this, I'm told they will look into my issue more thoroughly, sounds all good right? Today I get another email from them, the exact same email I received last time (word for goddamn word). What is the point in pretending you're going to deal with my issue if you're going to put such little effort into concealing the fact that you have done absolutely nothing? Do Just Eat just assume their customers are too stupid to realise? Or too lazy to persist? Nothing annoys me more than companies who take their customers for granted in this way, I order food occasionally out of convenience and thankfully it was just me on my lonesome this time, what if I was ordering for a family? I've been ordering from Just Eat for as long as I can remember, yeah I don't get a bucket in every week, but I've given them enough over the years and I've NEVER claimed food wasn't delivered to me. Welp what can ya do? The most annoying thing about this (and I take full responsibility for being duped twice) is that this all happened to me with Deliveroo! Both have terrible customer service, basically you're fine on 99.9% of your orders, but pray that a restaurant doesn't F you over because believe me, these guys will not lift a finger to solve it.",2020-09-25 09:14,{1: 'Bad'}

Not only was the order a hour and a half late, it was stone cold and the delivery driver made no attempt at an apology. She simply said that she did not speak English, shrugged her shoulders and walked off. I tried to request a refund and complain to Just Eat. What a joke! Seven different operators all asking me what the problem was with no solution, no refund, barely an apology and just talked nonsense at me for an hour! I asked how to get a card refund as I had no intention of ordering from them again and no one could tell me. Their site is ridiculous when it comes to a complaint as you just get passed through one 'call' to another and there is no direct way to request a refund anywhere! When I called Macdonalds they could not believe it had taken so long and told me that next time I visit the restaurant they would give me a free meal as a way of saying sorry. They were polite, apologetic and very professional. In comparison Just Eat said to leave a review for the restaurant and they would feed back to them how dreadful they were with no one wanting to share the blame etc. I am utterly appalled by the lack of customer service, empathy, helpfulness or regard for my two tired, hungry and tearful children who I had promised a treat to! In the end I had to cook for them otherwise they would not have eaten till late and would have had to go straight to bed!

I kept being promised a refund within 24 hours and it never happened. I have chased and chased and got no where. I then just tried to speak on line to someone who cut me off!

JustEat,5f5af97e02e8570af01f13c5,5f5af8d7278b7c245844ed9b,Just Eat going downhill fast.,"They used to be able to deal with problems quite efficiently when their customer service department was in the UK. Now you have absolute 0% chance of resolving anything with these 1diots.  They have become so incompetent over the last few years, customers (the people actually ordering the food) and their partners (which are the food establishments that provide the food) are finding it impossible to deal with this company. Avoid Just Eat,Uber Eats and Deliveroo  if you can because the food establishments will inevitably increase their prices or reduce their offers on these platforms to cover the costs. They can charge the restaurants anywhere between 20%-35%. If a food establishment has their own delivery service ringing them directly or using their website will normally be cheaper. Food Hub is another good option at the moment (they charge the restaurants 0% commission) so they should be able to give better deals on this platform. One thing is definitely for sure Just Eat is becoming a joke, but I suppose they had to cut some corners to give Snoop Dogg his 5 million.",2020-09-11 04:13,{1: 'Bad'}

I phoned Just Eat 1 hour after the order was placed to say he had not returned and I had not got my food! They then responded with “unfortunately we cannot do anything as the order was marked as complete” so your customers don’t matter? Then they said the only way they could do anything would be to send this to the investigations team who would take 48 hours to reply! Then I also got a reply saying “the investigation team have spoken to the restaurant and can confirm the order was delivered and will be unable to issue a refund” I phoned back immediately to which I was told “I’m sorry about this I will pass this onto the investigations team who will contact you in 48 hours” I heard nothing! So phoned back for a 3rd time (one week later) and was told exactly the same thing again! It seems no one has ‘authority’ to refund or even do anything!

On one occasion I ordered some food which was never delivered dispute the app saying the driver was on his way for 45 mins. Phoned the restaurant they had no record of my order so it became apparent no food was coming. Phoned just eat explained the problem and said I wanted my money back. The lady was understanding until she went to cancel and said she could only give me 50% back. I demanded I wanted full money back as I had paid them and not received anything. Not my fault. After 30 mins back and forth and me literally arguing with the customer service assistant eventually I got a full refund but by this time I was fuming. Wrote an email complaining about my customer service experience and didn't get any kind of reply. I've now cancelled my account and deleted the app. Will not be using again.

I live at the top of a three storey block of flats and was not prepared for carrying a bag with gravy dripping everywhere, the entire communal stairway is now covered in gravy as is the carpet within my property, i have also burnt my hands trying to stop more gravy from pouring all over the carpets. I will attach some photos of how my food was delivered and i am sure you will agree that it is just an absolute disaster. To make matters worse i complained to just eat and had to have a 15-20 minute message conversation with someone who would only refund 20 of the £25 i have spent on the food and then i would have to completely reorder.
