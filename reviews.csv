Wanted to get rembushed for different in cost. Been out of pocket over this last time so I didnt't want excuses but live chat staff tried to end my chat twice and was passed onto a manager who tried to end it as well with excuses. Each case is looked into and wasn't accepted for a refund. I'm £3.75 out of pocket.,2021-04-09 16:55,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606cd01df85d7508704c27da,606ccfe826bd26001b4410a6,"Scam! Charged multiple times for missing items, refused a refund","SCAM - I am surprised they are still allowed to operate! Customer service is terribly poor (at least in Edinburgh, Scotland, though since it's an international company, it's probably the same everywhere). A restaurant (Subway) failed to deliver some items and also delivered wrong items - I was refused a refund, basically paying for food that never arrived. Talking to Deliveroo ""live agents"" feels like talking to a rude chatbot - it looks like they have a system where they will refund you once or twice but will stop refunding after that as if it were the customer's fault that he or she receives an incomplete or wrong order more than twice. I order quite frequently and am a paying ""Deliveroo plus"" subscriber (though after recent experiences I will not be renewing my subscription).The script with ""live agents"" (although ""zombie agents"" would be a more accurate description) usually goes like this:1) I'm sorry to hear that - let me look into it for you.2) Thanks for waiting. I'm sorry for the problems you've had with your order, we will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. We're unable to offer you a refund in this instance.When challenged why they charge for wrong items or items that never arrived, they respond with:1) We review each claim on a case by case basis and have taken all the information you have provided into consideration. Based on the information available, we're unable to offer you a refund.2) I'm sorry that you are unhappy with the resolution, if you would like to discuss this further, please send us an email to [Deliveroo's email address]They claim to contact you by email within 24-48 hours but at least on two separate occasions failed to do so.I strongly encourage other people in the same situation to take LEGAL ACTION against Deliveroo using SMALL CLAIMS COURT or similar courts in your jurisdiction. Being forced to pay for food that never arrived is stealing and would never happen in an actual restaurant - they really are milking it during the lockdown/pandemic when very few alternatives are available and most people can't be bothered spending so much time chasing a huge unresponsive company that steals from people while many are struggling financially due to the pandemic.UNETHICAL AND RUDE!",2021-04-06 21:18,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606ca044f85d7508704bc773,5d89d54c7c6eb177e6857c7b,If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have had previous bad experiences with Deliveroo where they didn't assign drivers for my delivery leading to me waiting for an hour before I call them and I am informed about there being no driver to deliver my food so I have to cancel my order and request a refund, which is only a credit to my Deliveroo account and not a credit to my bank account. Because of this I haven't really been using them. But 2 weeks ago I wanted a pizza so ordered on at 7.20. I had an ETA of 8.05. At 8.15 I called the restaurant and the line was engaged. This went on until 9.00. I had intended on sharing this pizza, with my daughter, but ended up having to make her something. I called Deliveroo at 9.15 and asked to speak to a supervisor when a refund wasn't granted. The supervisor refused and said they had to investigate which would take 72 hours. So at 9.45 I have to bundle my sleeping daughter in the car and go to the McDonald's drive through. While I am there I receive a call and when I ask if it's the pizza delivery guy he hangs up. When we get home at almost 10.00 there's a stone cold pizza outside my door. Deliveroo and all these other fast food delivery services are a joke. In the end my bank did a charge back(which I hope all of the many disgruntled customers are using, because when they refuse you a refund they're hoping we'll just swallow it, but most banks will support you). I think I'm a big softy at heart because after my previous experiences with Deliveroo I kept my account, but on this occasion enough is enough and they've been cancelled. Deliveroo are a massive con, because they charge an average of £5.00 a delivery plus card fee(unless you are a direct debit customer, which is what they are trying to push all of their customers towards), and many of their drivers don't know where they are going even after I have put instructions on how to find me. I have lost count of the amount of times I have been asked to come and collect my food (which I always refuse because the delivery is paid for). Also their customer service isn't very good, as they are based overseas and don't know anything about the local area or how close things are. As when a driver hasn't arrived after 2 hours and the restaurant is less than 2 miles away you would think that they would understand how bad the level of service is, but they don't. MY ADVICE TO ANYONE READING THIS IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND WHEN YOU SEE GET DELIVERY FOR FREE, AVOID AVOID AVOID. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO STRIPE YOU UP TO BECOME A CUSTOMER PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. I WISH WE COULD GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE RESTAURANTS HAD THEIR OWN DRIVERS INSTEAD OF USIBG THESE SERVICES, AS IT'S THE FOOD WE WANT. NOT THE MIDDLEMAN.

After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting (which I sat by the window 10 minutes prior to delivery time so I could watch for them) I  contacted deliveroo through their live chat and was told that she had spoken to the Gold Moon and the food would be with me in 5 mins. So 5 mins later I phoned Gold Moon myself. It seems they travel in a tardis to make their deliveries. I was told by a very rude and unhelpful man that the driver had in that 5 mins drove to my address, tried to contact me, then drove back to the restaurant and explained what had happened before I rang. Quite a miracle as its a 15 min round trip.I contacted deliveroo by email and attached screenshots of all communication and call logs which quite clearly prove the driver could never have been here. The next day I called deliveroo who were about as useful as a chocolate tea pot. The woman I spoke to had no interest in trying to help and just kept banging on about having to speak to the restaurant as they did their own deliveries. They needed to ask whether the food had been delivered according to them. Well of course they're going to say it has you dozy mare! And surprise surprise I received an email saying the restaurant had confirmed they had tried and therefore I wasn't entitled to a refund.Turns out the place has a reputation for taking payments and not delivering the I've since found out when I googled them. There are many reviews saying the same thing. In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the rating before I ordered. Then again you wouldn't expect a company as big as deliveroo to allow scamming, thieving businesses to trade through them.Anyway I contacted my bank and disputed the payment and got my money back.

This is below their costs, and means they’re actually loosing money to work with Deliveroo, who have so far refused to deal with them and even suspended their account for complaining. Looking on the internet there are various articles showing this is not an isolated case by some rogue employees or a coding error, but their actual business model during the pandemic. Whilst they know that many restaurants have no other route to market and are desperate, they’re just charging very high commission rates, knowing full well these companies are on their knees and unable to fight back. Without these partner companies, Deliveroo is nothing but this is how they treat them during a national crisis. And it gets worse, they also regularly see which restaurants are most successful in a given area and copy their menu with minor tweaks operating out of industrial units with their own ""exclusive brands"", so they can steal their market share as well as charge high levels of commission. Clearly this is to try and bolster profits prior to their up-coming IPO, but at what cost, effectively extorting small businesses who cannot fight back, absolutely disgusting and predatory. And reading other reviews here, I guess unsurprisingly they treat the riders poorly too.I've cancelled my premium account today and deleted the app and shown this to everyone I know, this kind of abusive way of running businesses makes me sick and I want no part of it.

She then told me that she would refund me £5.99 so I could re-order it, however I let her know £5.99 would cover the food but not delivery and service which I had already paid for initially when I ordered the food, so I wouldn’t be able to get it delivered for that price.After 5 minutes of arguing with me, she said she’ll speak to someone and put me on hold again for a few minutes, and then told me she could refund the delivery fee but not the service fee, I told her this is still unacceptable since I still would not be able to get the food delivered for that price.I then asked her why she couldn’t call the delivery driver and ask him if he could deliver the food if he still had it and she told me that it’s been 20 minutes now and the food would be bad quality. Which was terrible because the food that was sitting on the table had been there for 20 minutes while I was on the phone with her. If she had come up with that resolution in the first place when I had called her, it would have been good quality food and arrived a minute later than expected.The reason I got so annoyed in the first place is that I  only ordered from Pizza Hut for the nachos, the rest of it I didn’t care about that much. I would’ve ordered elsewhere if I knew I wouldn’t get the nachos.Overall very dissatisfied with the service, not only did I not get the nachos, I didn’t get the bare minimum refund so I could re-order them. Honestly after the inconvenience you would expect a good will gesture not an argument.Regards,Sean",2021-03-26 10:59,{1: 'Bad'}

They didn‘t look left nor right and kept on cycling wherever they want. I get the drivers want to be as fast as possible and are under time pressure, but it‘s a huge safety hazard because the cyclist usually come out of the middle of nowhere, they are quick and usually don‘t even see or watch out for pedestrians. For the service: ordered twice, the drivers were always friendly and thankful about tips. Once though we waited for four hours because the delivery vehicle broke down and they had to place a new order. That was a bummer, but the food was worth it. And to be fair, a competent Asian woman immediately called and there was transparency, but I‘d rather this did not happen. I would get a Deliveroo subscription, because they do have more restaurants than Justeat. My main concern though are the cyclists who don‘t care for human lives.

Last night was the last straw. We ordered food at 7p.m. and the deliveroo app gave us one hour waiting time. Which then stretched to almost 3 hours. The last notification I've received from deliveroo was saying that ""Alex"" was delivering our food at 9.50 p. M. After this, Alex went off the tracking system and so my dinner. A huge disappointment. I will never ever ever order with deliveroo again. That dinner was supposed to be the highlight of the week for us. Completely ruined by deliveroo.

Why should I pay for that exactly?Then they were hacked... I noticed a strange order appear to a new address, then another order to same place... So I got on the chat and and the call center person gave me 2 options.1: Live with the fact I'll be buying strangers food.2: They would close my account immediately. When asked should I call my credit card to reclaim the amount they had billed me they reluctantly said they would refund me. I guess they didn't want to incur the fees my CC would charge them for a disputed transaction. Oh and if you want to use deliveroo after you need to get a new email address to register with...What I also noticed was in early days they wanted to help with problems, fast forward a few years and when you discover chicken in your vegetarian dish they make life difficult. You need to photo the problem, then 24 hours late they complain the photo doesn't clearly show it chicken can you send another zoomed in... yes of cause I kept in in my fridge just in case...

All that wasn't too bad. But what was unacceptable to me was that the server I was speaking to disconnected the chat while I was still in it. I was not unresponsive for a long time. In fact, they had disconnected the minute they sent the last message. Even if they were to disconnect, they should have sent a message saying they were going to. Live customer service chats aren't innovative to Deliveroo. How come other companies, whether it'd be internet providers, phone companies, online shopping sites, have managed to use live chats successfully but not Deliveroo?Upon reaching out through email I was also ignored until now. They wasted no time in sending promotional emails during that time though. Obviously, you can tell what's important to them. And I trust that the delay is not because they haven't had time to reply but because they straight up don't care what concerns I'm having.Anyway, 9 days later I never got a refund or email confirmation. So of course, I contacted their live chat again. I was told that the refund had actually been added to my account as credit but that they will redirect it to my bank account.I didn't know such poor customer service still existed nowadays as I had been using other services.This all happened during their $1 delivery promo and now I know why they needed it.Lesson: don't expect much from cheap things.",2021-03-15 08:46,{1: 'Bad'}

What makes me mad is why accept the order. Two emails saying we will not refund you as they think i am lying about this.

Absolutely not. Do they try to resolve the issue? Nope just offer a generic apology and take your money. Now they’re telling me to email support to get my money back after get another order with missing items as they’re unable to refund me. Why can’t supermarkets mark items as out of stock so I’m not charged for them? Why don’t the drivers check if all items are there before leaving the store?

Deliveroo,60463132f85d750394240468,604631031c1cb5001911a9c5,Deliveroo's IPO is going to be interesting...,"Based on my recent experience with Deliveroo it feels like a company in real trouble desperately trying to make the numbers stack up for their IPO. I have used Deliveroo a lot over lockdown, and have happily paid for their Deliveroo Plus subscription for the last six months or so.The service was generally pretty good, but occasionally things go wrong. That's fine, I understand that. They were generally pretty good at fixing things when they did - until recently.I had a series of orders go wrong: one driver claimed not to be able to find my building, and claimed he had called me, and just disappeared with £50+ of curry. Another driver delivered a £20 order to an entirely different building. ""OK, sure, whatever,"" I thought. ""Not a big issue, as when this sort of stuff happens Deliveroo are good at sorting it out.""How wrong can you be? Both times, Deliveroo refused to refund me for these, claiming their T&Cs meant *I* was at fault. After much back and forth I finally got the refunds. That was the point that the warning signs began to appear. Problem is, it's convenient. ""I'll give them another chance,"" I thought. BAD IDEA. Things have gone from bad to worse.The final straw was when I ordered some groceries from the Coop - everything came except a £3 box of blueberries. Fine, no problem. I reported it as missing in the app - previously when something similar had happened (some salmon missing) I reported it in the app and they simply corrected the amount billed to my card. Not this time: I got an email telling me that they were not going to refund me for this. No reason why. I queried this. Still no reason given. I told them that I was insisting in on a refund and would not give up.I then got an email from one of their customer service reps threatening to terminate my Deliveroo Account and implying that I'd previously made fraudulent claims. Interesting, given that *every single time* I had an issue I sent them photographs and they refunded me without quibbling, until the past few weeks. I told them that if they were going to allege I was breaching their T&Cs they should send me that evidence - and if they could not, I expected the £3 refund within 72 hours. £3 refund came through.Now, obviously I wasted WAY more than £3 of my time on this. But the thing is, why should a company promise to deliver something, bill you on that basis - and then when they don't send something they promised, claim that you should still be billed in full? That makes me really furious. First time it was £50 of curry, second time it was £20 of wine, third time it was £3 of blueberries. I can understand the £50 hit - no company wants to have lots of those. But £3 of blueberries: that's the price they put on my loyalty as a long standing, moderately high-spending customer, and clearly that's what their brand equity is worth.£3.Pathetic.I'm assuming this is them trying to tighten things up in the run up to their IPO, and the customer service team have been told to aggressively dispute everything to increase revenue. Doesn't bode well for the post-IPO status of the company if they have to use dishonest tactics like this in order to protect revenues.It'll be interesting to see what price the stock floats at - as it will surely be hugely overvalued based on this. You can be aggressive with your customers for a couple of months, but when you absolutely destroy customer trust and loyalty the business is built in shakey foundations.I've now cancelled my Deliveroo Plus membership and will move my spend elsewhere.",2021-03-08 14:14,{1: 'Bad'}

It's sole purpose is to squeeze money from you by operating close to boundaries of the law. Probably breaking the law 99% of the time because they mislead you on order time a lot of the time. It's Friday, they are short on riders but inform you of usual 20min delivery time from local KFC on the app (which now I know it's not true)... but really they know they can't achieve this and delivery would take more than an hour or more. On this occasion they have already taken nearly 2 hours. I am still waiting. I wanted to cancel but they are refusing to refund because apparently KFC is already prepping my order.It's like dealing with a dodgy street market seller. That's very much their business not to mention how they mistreat their workers paying them next to nothing.My GF and I have probably ordered on 3 occasions with Deliveripoo on a Friday... and always they fail. After two fails, we should have known better... we placed the order at 6.45pm thinking we missed the queue, it's now 8.45pm.... and Deliveripoo have extended delivery time by another 10mins for the 11th time...

I go on live chat and ask them to cancel the order and they say they can't because KFC already has my order.I ask them what to do about the extra £10 I've just been charged and they flat out refuse to help - I have a joint bank account with my wife and apparantly she's ordered using her own card before, which means my deliveroo account and hers are judged to be the same account.Tried explaining that we weren't notified of any stipulations with the order not being able to use a bank account that's been used before, and that if I was really doing this to scam a tenner I wouldn't be asking for the order to be cancelled completely, but the agent kept trying to terminate the chat after not getting a response every 30 seconds.Couldn't even reject the delivery at the door as the doorbell rang, and as soon as I got to it the driver was already in his car driving away. To cap it off, food was stone cold and had items missing. No one would willingly pay nearly £40 for a KFC for 3 people, let alone one that was freezing. Going to open a claim with the bank and won't use deliveroo again. Crap service at unreasonable prices, Just Eat isn't much better service wise but is a hell of a lot cheaper for the same food!Also, check through the other reviews, this isn't the first time they've screwed over customers with promo codes.

Deliveroo, a refund is when a company returns the money a customer has spent with them directly to that customer, because the service or goods that were purchased were either unavailable at source, defective, incorrect at delivery, or simply didn't arrive.It is illegal in the UK to withhold a refund from customers with a genuine reason and argument in favour of having their money returned. The payment should be returned directly to the customer using the method they paid with, i.e. credit card, cash, debit card or bank transfer, or whichever method the client chooses, within 14 days of the initial transaction.

An hour after the estimated delivery time had been and gone and there was still no sign of the food (the restaurant refused to answer the phone), we managed to get through to Deliveroo's customer service. We requested a refund for the meal, which the Deliveroo employee agreed to. During this conversation, the order updated to say that it had been delivered - it had not. By this point it was so late in the evening that we ordered another meal, which arrived on time. Cut to the present; since then (nearly 2 weeks ago now) I've been in a very long email battle to receive compensation for that disastrous first order. Despite providing them with screenshots of the conversation that I'd had with the Deliveroo employee that evening, I've been refused any form of compensation beyond ""we're sorry that happened to you"".I have been told that ""the restaurant uses their own riders and you would have been notified of this at checkout"". Even if you're a Plus member a ""service fee"" is still taken for Deliveroo - surely then you have responsibilities to provide said service? I have also been told no on the grounds of the restaurant's delivery confirmation - hard to prove otherwise but a blatant and total dismissal of my complaint versus the restaurant providing false information (even when captured in screenshots)? I've argued my case, but have been refused multiple times.Honestly? I personally despise confrontation and have never in my life left a public review like this, but the treatment I've experienced as a long-standing Deliveroo Plus customer is shocking.As of today, I've cancelled my subscription.",2021-02-22 12:11,{1: 'Bad'}

Customer services on Live chat stated that they can't do anything else in this case and to email support, not what you want to hear after intentionally ordering food as your busy and do not be inconvenienced with cooking instead I find myself on the phone line which is screeching loud as can be and providing my email for a solution, Lady was very decent but still her decency isn't what's under review here, it's the company that is. (Spoke to Tacobell too the guy literally said Deliveroo are lying if they are saying they cant do anything.)Time before this was shocking, the lid had popped off the curry it had spilt everywhere we initially got offered a refund which we could only spend with Deliveroo again no solution to a meal that we actually wanted to eat in the moment. And the other time we ordered a food shop which had items missing we ordered it so we didn't need to the shops because of Corona Virus but yeah had to go down anyways to grab the missing items. One was a key ingredient to a meal so... I get none of this is ""The end of the world"" but if we think about why we get a take away...- minimize inconvenience - instant satisfaction- because your hungry at the time Not one of these boxes are ticked messing up 3/5 times is not okay and when you take in mind the inconvenience of having to complain... Call up the phone number... and the time you actually spend on the phone with them if you actually value your time and your experiences it just really doesn't sit well.

Deliveroo,602c41e0679d9708b4d89053,602c4153b1558c001aad0e5b,Deliveroo are running a big scam be careful with bad customer service,"For the past few month deliveroo has been taking £11.49 from my account for no reason and when I ask them why, they aren’t even able to give me a reason for this transaction ? At first i contacted them last month after i noticed theweird transaction. When i first contacted the customer service he had the audacity to tell me they didn’t take anything. Even though i have the proof in my bank statement it made absolutely no sense. But since i was busy i decided to just wait and see if they would dare do this again in January. And of course like the shameless scammers that they are; they did ! So this time i emailed customer service again, but this time i was not going to let them play with me, i pulled up with receipts, screenshots, everything. At first they kept asking me for the same documents again and again, i think it was to make me lose my time so i would give up, little do they know i am unemployed i will get my £11.49, i don’t have anything better to do. So i kept sending the receipts they were asking + the one they asked previously to make sure they couldn’t ask it again. Eventually all the documents had been given, but of course the scammers still found a way to delay it by asking me if the transaction was still showing in my bank app? Now i have heard a lot of stupid questions in my days but if you haven’t refunded me my money and you have screenshots of the transaction AND official transaction receipt, how in god’s name fo you expect the transaction to be gone? Again i gave them all the information they needed but they’ve been taking their sweet time . As i am writing this review i still didn’t get my refund. I looked around the internet to see what people thought about this big joke of a delivery service. And online i found so many people complaining of the exact same thing : -taking money for no reason -horrendous customer service So my question is: if we are all being scammed by deliveroo, why are we allowing this to happen ? I’m not the first one that get scammed by deliveroo and then receive horrible costumer service in response (clearly  just people trying to make you waste time and think you’re an gullible idiot ) so we should do something about this. Are you guys trying to sue ? I feel like we deserve reparation for the emotional damage deliveroo has caused and they should be charged with fraud. I am ready to fight deliveroo, i will get my £11.49 or die trying. Don’t play with me in the middle of a pandemic, i’m broke and i have time, it’s a bad combo deliveroo! The only reason i put one star is because i can’t put 0. So if you’re thinking of creating a deliveroo account it’s not worth it, they will steal your money mess up your order and when you try to complain you’ll be met with extreme incompetence. Use Uber Eats instead they are real ones, they might mess up some times but their customer service is bomb!",2021-02-16 22:06,{1: 'Bad'}

Now Deliveroo is refusing to issue the refund claiming they cannot reach the restaurant to verify this. They squarely blamed me for ordering from a restaurant that does its own delivery.

Called Deliveroo to complain and ask for 3 more pizzas to be delivered so that these amazing volunteers don't go hungry - 'sorry, we can't. We need to investigate first and this can take up to 48 hours.' So when asked if these 3 volunteers were going to be left hungry because they refused to authorise 3 pizzas, there was no useful response.  Deliveroo - you can afford 3 pizzas whilst you do your investigations.  Especially for people who are coming out in the freezing cold to help others during this very difficult time.  To say I am appalled and disgusted is a HUGE understatement. You need to review your bureaucratic processes and learn to do the right thing.

Not much use when you’re hungry. I checked the app the next morning and saw a credit for the pizza was there - I’d received no email, message, etc to let me know this.So I spoke to someone on live chat and requested a credit for the redundant pizza dip too. I was told that as that was not damaged, they would not offer credit. That person then cut me off and another came on. I said to this person that if they wouldn’t credit me the dip then I wanted a refund for the pizza instead as would not be using Deliveroo again. This person said they would’ve have redelivered another pizza that night so wouldn’t credit dip. When I advised the app message said a 2 day response time, his reaction was ‘oh’ - he then processed me a refund rather than a credit.Seems crazy to lose a regular customer over £1.50.

I made my first ever account with Deliveroo after finding they delivered in my area and used my boyfriends card with his permission to order a Nando’s after a tiring day. I applied my discount for £10 off £15 and processed the payment on the order screen, an error message came up mid way through advised that I did not meet the criteria for the promo code and that it was being removed, at this point you be expected to be redirected to the payment screen to review the new payment and then proceed just to make sure you can confirm and agree that price? WRONG! It bumped the price up by £10 mid transaction and took more than originally quoted on the payment screen. I tried to cancel, it would not allow me to cancel. I called to speak to someone who just referred me back to T&C’s which did not help, I asked her if I can cancel and she simply said “no” and the reason I wasn’t able to use the discount is because the card I used has been used on a Deliveroo order before, 4 years ago my partner ordered a McDonald’s at work and used his card to pay for it. I appreciate on that basis the card was recognised as a prior card used on their system making me ineligible for the discount, but I expected once the error message flagged up advising I wasn’t eligible it would cancel the transaction and let me check my order as I didn’t consent to that price.Complaint reviewed by Sheila who referred me to T&C’s again as to why I wasn’t eligible, even though that isn’t the issue. The issue is an unauthorised payment being taken from the account!I then spoke to a manager who explained that they cannot issue me a refund of £10 as I did not print screen the order showing £19.64 which why would I?

We recieved a call at 8:43 (possibly from the rider) who perhaps could not hear us, although we could hear noise from his side. We called back but there was no answer. We went outside our flat during this cold rainy night and stood outside for 5 minutes thinking the rider may be lost. But there was no sign of him.We came back up to our flat and checked status online which said the food was delivered at 8:40pm. Bizzare and fraustrated, we called Deliveroo. After waiting 15 mins for someone to pick up, a representative picked up. She initially tried to help and spoke to the driver, who told her that he was sent to a wrong address and no one picked up his call. And that he made way to his second delivery. I kept my calm, until the representative (who sounded like reading scripted lines) tried to get me to order again as last order appeared to be ""delivered"". But, the restautant closed by then. She kept repeating the same thing when my simply question was: why did the rider lie that he delivered the food? and why did he not try to contact us for the second time or even try to simply use google map to find our flat. We placed order using web browser and not the app, and it is not the customer's fault that Deliveroo's web browser does not allow for pin drops like the app! The representative first tried to place the blame on us although our address was perfectly written on the order. After staying on call for 20 minutes, she just told me that she and the company is ""sorry"" for the inconvinience. There was no offer to redirect the order and by the time I left the phone it was too late to order from any other shops. Because of deliveroo, our friday night has been ruined.

I told the customer service again that this is not acceptable and demanded to be refunded which they did at the end after talking to their senior manager.

I had been using Deliveroo for around a year and until this point had no reason to raise a complaint even if the service or delivered food was less than perfect.Firstly when I described the abundantly obvious problem it was clear I was talking to an automated bot for the first five minutes.  Canned responses.  Fine.  Eventually I got through to a person.  In summary these are the reasons for a 1* review:1.  The chat was ended four times by the assistants whilst I was typing answers to their questions, so I had to start again.  Eventually committing 35mins of my life to this but felt I was a the point of not return!2.  I had no response in over 24 hours to my complaint.  3.  Worst of all the last assistant seemed to be doing her best to patronise and downplay before telling me my problem doesn't fall into their refund policy.  If it didn't then what on Earth does?I didn't need a full refund.  All I wanted was a gesture and I would have forgotten it and ordered again the next day.  @Deliveroo....this tells me....your people are not good enough.

Even though I had an account with deliveroo I never used them due to cost. I favoured Just Eat. Just Eat, though, started delivering very unreliably so I decided to try Deliveroo. My first order with them was on 19th November and then I had 10 more orders with them. During that time period I never contacted them in any shape way or form other than for the delivery order. However, I was happy with their service and started trialing premium membership. I'm front line NHS worker and things were tough a week at the hospital so I was relying on delivered food. On the 9th of Jan I had my 11th order with Deliveroo but my card payment kept being declined. I thought the bank blocked my account and so I contacted them and they told me it had nothing to do with them, they had approved the payment and the error was with Deliveroo and to contact them. Then I entered the twilight zone. As I came to find out Deliveroo has no direct number and you can only contact via chat. Via chat they told me they would look into it and they would get back to me via email within 2 working days. I said this was not resolving my problem as I needed to order food then and why was I paying for premium membership. They said they would look into it. Again then they said they would get back to me via email in 2 working days. I said I was unhappy with this and I would cancel my membership, which I did. Thank the gods that happened to be just in time of the trial period so I never paid them the extra membership money. I then forgot about them as I saw customer service was non existent and went happily about my life. I also did not hear back from them within working days but I could also care less. Until today. Today they sent me the email attached below. Given that I never asked them for a refund and have never contacted them in the past to compliment, complaint, or even on error, I find this to be a highly harassing email from a service I had already let go.

Deliveroo,600ec637679d97067cf9a5a2,56fe3fce0000ff000a1382e2,Appalled by today’s service.,"Appalled by today’s service. I ordered food for some family members who have COVID with their mom admitted in intensive care and dad too ill to cook for their 3 children (all under 18 with the youngest one 5 and the middle one with learning difficulties). Between order and delivery, it took 2 hours. I ordered well in advance so they will have food in time but this was not the case. I’m sure we all know how angry, grumpy and sad being hungry makes us, so imagine how a child will feel. No child should have to wait for their food, we’re not asking for charity! Deliveroo proposed around £6 credit to my account for this. Money won’t change anything but it, of course, definitely helps. I requested Deliveroo to either provide more credit or 50% the next order as I will need to order for their food until their mom comes back (I don’t live near them otherwise I would have made and delivered the food myself). I made this request on the basis that Deliveroo is always giving its customers random discount etc. And surely this wouldn’t have put them out of pocket but this would have been regarded as a nice gesture. I use Deliveroo quite often, but this is the last time I’ll be using Deliveroo. So utterly disappointed.",2021-01-25 13:23,{1: 'Bad'}

They thought it perfectly acceptable to refund the rice and I could eat a curry without. My daughter and I ordered a meal on Saturday from a new outlet. The meal arrived over 30 minutes after expected time. The containers were on their side, liquid had spilt over all contents. The food was lukewarm and not our order. We rang deliveroo to be told we would be credited with the cost of the meal. There is never any offer of compensation. We were left without a meal.

Firstly it’s actually cheaper if you order through the restaurant directly via their own website/phone. Secondly the customer service from deliveroo is SHOCKING. I ordered from them for the first time when I was 10 weeks pregnant. The food I got came fast and on time, however two of the dishes weren’t as they should have been. I know this isn’t deliveroos fault so I contacted the restaurant directly and they were really apologetic but said because I ordered through deliveroo I needed to peruse it through deliveroo. If I ordered from them directly they would have been able to sort directly for me. So I called the helpline for deliveroo and was told due to the circumstance the food was not acceptable, they would happily arrange a refund for the two (out of five) items i ordered. It was confirmed with a supervisor and I was told I’d receive an email within 5 working days regarding a refund. No email, so I contacted them again. They gave me an email to send to and apologised. No reply for two weeks. Once a reply was received they said they apologised for the wait and was forwarding my query to the relevant person(s). Again no response after that so I emailed again and again. A month later I receive an email from Starlet saying no refund would be processed and no reason why. Just a short blunt email. So I asked: why? I’ve been told I could get a refund, the restaurant was on board? To that, just another blunt email ‘we’ll use your experience for future reference’ This is absolutely by far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Firstly recieving food that was off while I’m pregnant and having to throw the food away because I don’t want to risk the health of my unborn baby - which the restaurant has taken responsibility for and said they’d refund the money through deliveroo - but mostly because of the disgusting service from deliveroo. Don’t bother using them, waste of money and time. They don’t care, they’re rude and they lie. Oh, and they charge more than restaurant prices too.

So you're literally asking for it.Here's a couple of suggestions to make the experience better: 1. Stop putting members of my community at risk 2. Acknowledge and respond to requests for basic hygiene and health policy information3. Facilitate the delivery of the correct food order and ensure that food is warm (one job, et al)4. Respond to complaints with customer service, not with an automated droid5. If you do have to use an automated droid then don't try and hide it6. Serious complaints team should try and acknowledge the actual complaint 7. Serious complaints team should avoid calling me 'Starlett' when responding to the serious complaint - the name of your automated droid8. Respond to data protection requests and avoid sending surveys to disgruntled customers who have made aforementioned requests. So yea, work on that. It's not that I have a particular problem with the name Starlett - I quite like it. It suits me. It's more the absurdity of it's use when a member of the serious complaints team (SCT) uses it. It is the equivalent of a member of the flying squad on the Sweeny kicking in the door and yelling ""FREEZE!"" then realising he got his service weapon mixed up with a sex toy.The part that makes me smile is that Starlett is the name of the automated droid responding to the customer complaints. So the crack member of the SCT (I am assuming an expert) not only didn't read my complaint, or absorb the most basic information, (like my name) but also didn't know enough about Deliveroids customer relationship management process to recognise the name of the droid they are mugging me off with!This now makes it a member of the Sweeny kicking in a door, service weapon mixed up with a sex toy, realising the door leads to the set of Pat Sharp's Fun House instead of a crime scene.

Deliveroo your behaviour towards customers is abysmal we are the reason you exsist! My review is based on the delivery of 'stone cold' food on New Years Eve for which Deliveroo were the delivery service. We purchased a meal from our local Wagamama and as soon as it arrived it was unpacked/served where we realised it was cold and so I called Wagamama to advise them and they offered either a replacement meal or a refund we went for the latter. Deliveroo customer service have contacted us twice and they signed off by saying ""we'll do better next time""- what next time???? We've asked you to make right on our order and to date you have not we will not use your service ever again and you should look to your competitors as an example of providing a decent level of service to their customers",2021-01-10 19:44,{1: 'Bad'}

We wasn’t contacted via phone call either. Their only solution was to wait another 40 minutes for a re delivery which would have meant a delivery at around 21:30. It was Such a disappointment.  We will not be using deliveroo if we decide to order food In again.

They don't allow you to complain more than once as they consider it a breach of their rules. They deliver cold food almost as a constant and have zero interest in resolving the issues. The drivers are paid a pittance and Deliveroo also rip the restaurants and cafes off by charging them up to 45% of the amount you pay - so they get over half the amount we pay for the takeaway. Let us all try and work with the restaurants and cafes and cut these vile and evil companies out. BTW, the tips you leave for the poor driver is taken by them and they remove a handling charge etc....usual sharp practices and as a multinational company, they also pay zero tax in the UK.

Deliveroo,5fed5671755dc1032c081b59,5fed556476582900197912f2,"Deliveroo service is flawed, thus bad","The Deliveroo delivery service is based upon non-employees taking rides selected by their software to deliver food. Up to this point, it is ok, as it works well in other countries. However, the riders are not properly vetted, trained or accountable for the service they provide.I have lived in two distinct areas of Greater London, one in zone 6 and another in zone 2. The service varies largely. In zone 6, you could say it is just alright. You get your food delivered, well packed and within good time. I only had occasional riders that were too lazy to come to my door and would rather deliver in reception.When I moved to zone 2, it was utterly terrible. 9 out of 10 deliveries had problems. Some were the restaurant's fault with missing or bad items, but most of them were with riders doing a myriad of mistakes up to the point of cancelling deliveries twice in a row!They are occasionally rude and most of the times lazy enough to even take the lift.I understand they have many deliveries and are paid little, but their job has to be fulfilled in full. If they do it correctly, they do not deserve a tip because it is their job. If they do it well enough, they are entitled albeit not required to be tipped.These problems happen and are getting out of hand of that Deliveroo mostly employ illegal immigrants that use borrowed or rented accounts. No vetting is done, and if they do wrong, there is simply no real accountability besides some app restriction towards more work and account cancellation. If they were at least contractors, properly registered and stuff, there would be accountability for their mistakes.Let's be frank here. This is one of the meagre jobs that a lot of people get to live by. I don't want to generalise as some people are genuinely doing good work and are honest, but come on. If you are not legally resident here, you are breaking the law, so can't expect better from these people.I am an immigrant myself, fully registered and legally employed, and think what many riders do is despicable at best.Well, away from my rant, I believe that Deliveroo is responsible for employing such people that do not have proper morals and work ethics. Therefore they deserve this review more than the riders themselves.The downside is that since there is little competition in my borough, I kind of have to suck it up. But certainly, when I move again, I will stop using their services altogether even if it means going for takeaways myself. Making money whatever means necessary is ugly and despicable at best!

It’s such a shame that a few bad delivery riders ruin the reputation of Deliveroo. I will put it down to the driver not the company or restaurant. The worst service I have ever received from a delivery service. I am in Hereford. This is the email I sent to Deliveroo which explains what happened last night. Avoid if you don’t want to be ripped off and treated appallingly. Order 1888/9401Hello,I had a delivery from you yesterday & I received the worst service I have ever received from a delivery company ever. I ordered my food from Pizza Hit order Number 1888 and when the delivery driver left the restaurant I watched him come close to my property but could see he had difficulty locating me. The driver telephoned me and unfortunately despite me & my mother desperately trying to guide him he claimed not to be able to find me. I watched him drive very close to my property but then drive off and the next thing I knew it said on tracker my order had been delivered. I telephoned & spoke to a very nice polite member of your staff who apologised and said he would reorder the food with a different driver order number 9401. I then watched as my order was “prepared” and then left restaurant. Again the driver couldn’t find my property apparently despite my house clearly showing where it was on tracker. I was asked to telephone him which I did and again had problems communicating so I said I would go up the road and find him. It was pouring with rain so I was soaked by the time I returned with my food. When I opened the pizzas & sides you could tell that it was the original order which had been attempted to be reheat. The food was inedible and I had to put the food in the bin. I am so angry as I had family around for Xmas and was treating them to some food. I waited almost 2 hrs for food that was inedible and almost cold. I order regularly from just eat, Uber eats & Deliveroo & I have never had such terrible service and I am not happy. What makes all this worse is I was using a gift voucher from my Mum & Dad to pay for this awful food. I can’t see myself using your service again in the future as you don’t expect to pay over £50 for food, wait for 2 hrs almost and also have to go out and find your driver, getting wet for the trouble. I have always been very happy using your service but you ruined my Xmas get together before we all lock down again. Mark Davies.",2020-12-24 13:32,{1: 'Bad'}

This has happened with another delivery company and they were happy to honour the discount. Why would i choose to put further money into a company to use my discount? If the discount was honoured i would of likely purchased again through them, but now there's no chance.IF YOUR DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PRIORITY, THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL DELIVEROO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2020-12-14 21:20,{1: 'Bad'}

I explained we did not want the pizza anymore and they are not to deliver it. At 22:00 they called to say the pizza was outside . We asked them to go away. We complained to deliveroo , who said we could not get a refund because we did not let them know before hand, which we did. So we have to pay for a meal they delivered 5 hours late . This is all due to deliveroo system crashing and providing no simple capability to cancel the order. Therefore beware if deliveroo have an IT issue the customer is at fault.

Easy enough to order but annoying that all products were inflated in price, plus large delivery charge, service charge of 5% on top plus they want you to tip the driver!! But needs must when you can’t get out of the house. I paid almost £20 for 2 pizzas, some coke, antibacterial wipes, bread & milk!!! Once the order arrived the driver left it on the doorstep for me which I asked in the notes as I was self isolating, which was great!! I noticed they had sent the wrong item. Unable to get hold of anyone from Deliveroo apart from to say an item was incorrect which they refunded into my account to credit.I didn’t want credit as had no intention of using the service again.Emailed 3 times (this was about a month ago now) to say I wanted a refund instead of the credit and never got a reply. Phone lines always busy too! I then got an email saying ‘don’t forget to use your credit before it expires!!’ What an absolute joke!!I gave up and decided I’d use my credit tonight as I’m obviously never gonna get my money back.Ordered a subway, used my credit and put to the rest with my own money. It said order received and money taken out of my bank, delivery would be 20-30 mins. So like 45 mins pass and I look on my orders and see no order there? Money is still out of my bank so I rang subway who hadn’t received the order and was nothing they could do, told me to get hold of Deliveroo.DM’d Deliveroo on Twitter who are just ignoring everyone and still can’t get through on the phone!Horrendous customer service. Safe to say I’ll never be using the service again and I’m not holding my breath for a refund.Sticking with Uber eats!! Please don’t use them it’s daylight robbery, and if they don’t want to refund you they just won’t.

I was very surprised to see that my ordered had a delivered status. We then try to call the customer service. This is the worse customer service I have ever heard. They were not helpful at all. They said to me your food was delivered at that address and we tried to call you on your number. I never received any call, se one the address was clearly mentioned and no one never even bothered to try to ring the bell. One day later, I received the following message from someone named Olivia:Hi ...,As we previously let you know, we are unable to offer you compensation for this order.Honestly this is the worse delivery company.

I decided to give it ago and they checked that on my bank account they decided to charge extra £3.5 for delivery!!! No notification on price change. Just charged with the extra fee!

On Friday evening, 27 November at about 6pm, we ordered a meal from Five Guys which didn't turn up.

I ran down the stairs and while on the doorstep, I received a message to state our order would be left on the doorstep. The only thing on the doorstep was me and no Deliveroo rider or food to be seen. When I rang Customer Service I asked her to speak to the driver. She said she did and that he had definitely rung the intercom. If he was close by he could have come back - it was literally a few minutes after he said he was here. I was offered a re-delivery which we received 15mins later minus all the fries. It was in a bag that had a completely different order ticket on it for a completely different address. When I rang again to complain, I was cut-off. I have since emailed and only received a generic email in response. The difficulty in getting in touch is a sign that they can't cope with all the complaints re their bad service.

This is understandable, it can happen. However, it did kind of ruin our overall meal, and we did expect some sort of compensation. The rep we spoke to offered the menu value of the item *as credit*. I expressed that i thought it would be fair to get 20-30% of the bundle value refunded, as the item was relatively cheap but important for enjoying the more expensive dishes (i.e., it was a dry carb to go with an expensive wet main). The reason i'm giving one star is that 3 times the rep just ended the conversation when i refused to accept the menu value. To be clear, i remained polite and respectful the whole time. I had to re-explain the situation 3 times, which further took away from my Saturday evening. I felt like they were purposefully doing this, which is extremely frustrating.

This is very annoying because the extra 20mins (at least) means that you get your order ice cold. The guy before you paid exactly the same as you, so it's like a lottery. Sometimes you get your order on time, and sometimes ""rider is delivering another order first"" and suddenly you have to wait an extra 20-30mins and you can be sure it's going to be cold. You should be able to accept (before paying) whether you want your delivery guy to deliver other orders first, and should be cheaper, like if you share an Uber.

They checked, admitted fault and were profusely apologetic and advised me to contact Deliveroo to be refunded. I contacted Deliveroo and was quite frankly appalled at the lack of customer care. I couldn't tell whether I was speaking to a human or a robot - the advisor was that robotic. They loosely apologised for the inconvenience but refused a refund. Really Deliveroo?! I called back to speak with another advisor to see if they could assist, but no - the same robotic, useless approach: loose apology and no offer of a refund.I should point out that I have a serious gluten allergy and I could have been admitted to hospital had I ate the food. Clearly Deliveroo think they are above the law and think that an incorrect order when an allergy is involved is acceptable practices. It is not, and is quite frankly dangerous.Deliveroo's approach, or lack thereof, is startling.

A dish on Deliveroo can cost about £4 more than it does direct from the restaurant. Then you've got the delivery fee which can be about £4 and the service charge is up to £2 now. If you take say a £10 burger and chips, it can land up costing you double on Deliveroo!On top of this there's the optional tip for the restaurant (no - you've already tipped yourselves by marking up your prices) AND the optional tip for the delivery driver. I have to say I never ever tip either. I feel bad for the delivery guys because I really don't have anything against them, but once I've paid the mark-up, the delivery fee and the service charge, I just can't do it; I'm not made of money.The 'offers' advertised on the site are also very misleading. I'm constantly seeing 'free delivery' everywhere but what they mean is, if you subscribe to their monthly thing AND spend over £25, THEN delivery is free. I don't know who's getting what money exactly but from a customer's point of view I feel it's kind of a rip-off.

Then, 3 days later, I get told I will be refunded only for the amount of the missing item. Useless as I had to order another take away and therefore the whole order should have been refunded. Also this refund will take another 5-10 days to arrive. So I’m out of pocket forever and even the tiny refund may not arrive until 2 weeks after my order.

I have had one instance where they didn't refund me for a case where they should have, but the rest of my interactions with them has made up for it.The last place I lived was not properly registered on maps, which made getting drivers to my door a ball ache. Every single time I had to contact them to say their GPS had taken them on the wrong road. It wasn't their fault, it was the landlord's fault for not registering the address properly. Unfortunately, most of the drivers didn't have a good grasp of English so the language barrier made this communication harder. I'm pretty sure one driver even had a panic attack, as after 20 minutes of trying to explain to them, they turned up to my door with an entourage of Deliveroo drivers holding their hand. I'm not joking, a literal Deliveroo convoy of 2 bikes and a car. I live somewhere much better now, and every delivery has been smooth as butter.While there seems to be some legitimate complaints in other reviews, trust me when I say 95% of them are from people who don't have 2 braincells to rub together.

Fair enough- it happens, but I wasn’t able to get in contact with them to let them know this is the case. I am happy with them bringing it to me later or refunding money to my bank account (and not a deliveroo credit).I don’t want to seem harsh, but it wasn’t like after over an hour of waiting for these few products from coop that they couldn’t have double checked that everything was there.

The person on the end of the online chat was abrupt and clearly just wanted to get rid of me, and tried twice to leave the chat even though I was still asking questions.I had raised a complaint to follow this with them, and despite an automatic response that they would respond within 24 hours I have heard nothing since (4 days later).I do not intend to use their service again.

When I tried to enquire it then took a further 45 mins with chat/calls with Wagamama blaming Deliveroo and vice Versa.

Deliveroo,5fa59f505e693f0acce1c8dd,5fa59f32d550110019a1b7d8,I have just had a very bad experience…,"This is the first negative food review I have felt the need to write as I am an extremely positive individual whom always tries to see both sides of a story and understands that everything can't be perfect right! However I strongly believe that writing this review is a good use of my valuable time to raise awareness amongst others! I have just had a very bad experience with deliveroo. I made an online order for a food delivery (dinner after returning home from a hard day at work lecturing in Health and Social Care during this COVID pandemic on the first day of the second lockdown) and the food I ordered never arrived. However I did receive an email from them stating that the food had arrived. So I made contact with them via their live chat online to discuss. First of all the chat operator stated that the food had been delivered, when I asked why the delivery guy did not ring my doorbell (white doorbell with my name clearly written on in which I stated in my order comments when placing my order) she then changed her comments and stated that actually the driver could not find my address so the food was not actually delivered, therefore he send me a message through the App to let me know. However I have not downloaded the App on to my mobile, I placed my order online via their website on my laptop so I did not see the message they stated that the driver send via the App. Deliveroo stated that I was not going to be given a refund because the driver delivered the food... even though we now know that he didn't because he couldn't find my address. I have written evidence that I screened shot from the live chat which shows the full content of the conversation that I had with the chat operator. I asked to speak with a manager and I asked for a name she stated she couldn't give me one. So I asked for a copy of the complaints policy and she referred me to the website to check out its terms and conditions which I did.  No where in their terms and conditions does it state that if the driver cannot find the address that the food ordered would be referenced/deemed as delivered and that you don't get your money back. I live a few roads away from the restaurant which the food was meant to be coming from. Its not a difficult address to find - infact its a well known address in my area - just of the Wandsworth Bridge Road in Fulham London, a simple house with a door number - on a simple road all clearly signposted with road signs and names... however according to deliveroo the driver could not find it. If the driver had a sat nav or mobile phone that is all that is required for him to find my address, he just needs to punch my postcode into whatever device he has right? and BANG he has my address, but it appears that was too much of a difficult challenge for him to do.  Deliveroo does not make any effort or attempt to direct a lost delivery driver to the right address, you would expect a delivery company to have some sort of procedure in place for that no? a quick chat with a lost driver on his mobile right, but no, that does not happen! You would assume that this would be something that deliveroo staff do to support their delivery drivers from a secure location in front of a computer, anywhere in an office or in someone's living or bedroom at home during lockdown right, as it doesn't seem too be much of a difficult task but they do not do this. So now I have to find the resources within my cupboard to make a last minute quick dinner for my children after a full on day at school for them and a full on day at work for me, children are already in their PJs. I don't want to risk getting them changed from their PJ's into thier day clothing to have to take them outside with me (because they are too young to leave at home alone) to the shops to buy food for dinner on the first day of the second lockdown. Let this be a warning to you all, please think twice about the company you use to deliver your food during lockdowns... it might not ever arrive and when you wonder why and approach the company to challenge why? they will tell you different stories and lie. They are dishonest, and function with the belief that if the driver doesn't know the address than that is an ok excuse to state that the food that has been delivered and use it as an excuse not to give you a refund as if its your fault and not theirs or the drivers who is not sat nav savy. I have all the written evidence from my chat with the online operator which I have screen shot with my mobile phone - I have also approached a well known newspaper to raise my concerns especially after reading all the other reviews on here about the negative experience they had too, very similar to mine. Shame on them!!!!  I will not be using them again. I ordered at 5pm. its now 7.05pm. Still haven't had a dinner and I have a hungry household.",2020-11-06 19:09,{1: 'Bad'}

First time using Deliveroo and definitely won't be using it again. I live in an apartment block with coded gates etc to get in.

I received a notification on the app that my order had arrived but no sign of the driver. I received a message from the driver just saying "" Hello "". I replied with ""I am on the main road beside the gate and gave him/her even more helpful directions"" I was across from a garage so it easy to find me. I waited some more but no delivery. I called the driver twice... no answer. Then all of a sudden, the app notifies me that the driver couldn't contact me and that the food was left at my door. NONE OF WHICH WAS TRUE.

Consequently, Deliveroo were notified of the missing items and  the fact that they had been paid for but not received. It was stated that they would respond within two days, but they never did. Following an email response to their support email address several days later, it was stated (by them)  that  “ We can’t offer you credit right now. We will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. “I then requested to know why a reimbursement could not be made for products that had been paid for, but not received. I  have received two emails in response to those forwarded  previously, at separate intervals, stating that reimbursement could not be made, as a complaint was needful of having been made within two days  of receipt of the order, however, I  reminded them that I had responded immediately on receipt of the order directly via their   contact info on their website, in which I had highlighted the two items which had been omitted from the order.Having then received a reply which reiterated that as I had not made a complaint within a specific two days, then a reimbursement would not be applied, I am therefore of the impression that even though I had responded immediately, then  responses via their recommended website contact process cannot be adequately proved, which is what must have transpired in my  particular case, even though later alternative communications  forwarded by email, appear to be acceptable as  proof of their existence.Do they not have a process for acknowledging and recording customers' responses to missing items following the fast-track recommended contact route from their website?I cannot understand how a supposedly reputable company such as Deliveroo can cheat their customers in this way; failing to provide the goods paid for and then declining a reimbursement.It would be interesting to know how many other customers have been treated in such a shoddy manner.It is also of concern that reputable companies such as Morrison's and shortly Aldi will be placing delivery options in the hands of Deliveroo.Needless to say I have now unsubscribed from Deliveroo and shall never be ordering from them again due to their abysmal attitude to customers.Incidentally, I am in my seventies and a so-called vulnerable person, but still retain the wherewithal to fight my corner, but believe that it is absolutely abhorrent that there will be others, who will be unable to do so.",2020-11-06 15:06,{1: 'Bad'}

To be told that the operator on the phone had already requested a redelivery and couldn’t process the refund. To be clear I asked how long the re-delivery would take and after hearing, I was very clear that I did not want it and only wanted a refund.I was then on hold for the best part of 20 minutes throughout our call while the operator struggled to rectify the error and issue the refund.I was also then told that there would be no additional compensation despite wasting my time and losing complete trust in the service. My view here is this error is entirely down to the deliveroo service and it is not the restaurant's fault.After arranging alternative food, we then get a loud knock/ door bell ringing at our door at a late time with the replacement food delivery. We deliberately didn’t want the redelivery to avoid such loud unexpected noises while our young children had gone to bed.Altogether a poor experience that will lead me to avoid deliveroo in the future and the unhelpful support after the error of no food will leave me with only very poor opinions to share with my friends and colleagues.To top it off - the automated response said they would respond within 24 hours.....

Deliveroo had already hid their customer service number and only provide an email adresse if you wish to complain or need to have a go at them for their not so clever scamming scam.

To cut the long short the driver had gone AWOL so a new driver was found. Deliveroo gave me £2.50 compensation. It is because of how they have dealt with these problems I have awarded them 3 stars.

There are other services that will deal with your disputes more effectively than Deliveroo. They automatically opted me into their monthly subscription of £11.49 last August 2019. As someone who usually buys things online I barely check my bank statements, I only found out last week when I saw a charge for £11.49. I contacted my bank and got that refunded. However, after raising the matter of what I deemed that somebody was using my details which they acquired from Deliveroo, nobody responded. Fast forward to a few days later, I come to know that they have been taking £11.49 for a total of 14 months without my permission! Trying to get into contact with them was a hassle, constantly getting ignored and then came and said they can only ‘compensate’ me 6 months’ worth of refunds. I was confused as to what they meant by ‘compensate’ considering it’s my money they have been taking my account without my consent to sign up for this so called ‘Deliveroo plus’ subscription. Of course, I wasn’t having that. I was still short of £90! I was calling up to their ‘customer service’ line for days on end as they kept telling me to email and that is the only way I can resolve the issue. They persisted that they cannot refund me any more money back. They illegally opted me into a monthly subscription without my consent on an account I had not even used since October 2019. I sent multiple letters to them via email asking them for proof that I had subscribed to Deliveroo Plus and a copy of the emails sent to me (of course I never got any as I never subscribed) and they were unable to provide the proof. THEY EVEN CHANGED THEIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON THE SAME DAY I RAISED THE DISPUTE FOR THE CHEEK! Totally illegal and dodgy to opt someone into a monthly subscription when they place one order with you guys. The customer service is none-existent. PLEASE AVOID. Not worth the stress they cause. Also, if they get your order wrong or items are missing, they add the amount as credit form to your Deliveroo account and not refund you the money to your card. Conveniently. Please look up all the complaints from hundreds of people on Twitter, Trust pilot if you want further proof. THE WORST!",2020-10-17 21:11,{1: 'Bad'}

The cheese cake was half like scrambled egg it had obviously took all the heat in the bag. Shame that heat wasn't evident when I got it. Everything was cold. So I phoned the restaurant said I wasn't happy with the quality of the food I paid £20 odd pound for. He came to collect it and was cheeky at the door told me I was wanting his food and money and I won't be receiving a full refund as I wasn't allowing him to amend the order. So I speak to Angel mae on the live chat on just eat and I get a forum explaining that every resteraunt has different ways of making things and unfortunately will not be receiving my money back. No, I was seething by this point. I ordered through just eat as I always do. I order mostly from this shop as its my local and I never complain. I've never asked for a refund in my life with just eat and I have o food to show for my money. So I asked Angel mae for a number to speak to some regaurding this. I get a recording of options I press 2 then 2 again then 3 and I think great I'll be through to someone the now to speak about this terrible order mix up and the recording tells me to query on the problem page and hangs up on my so I'm dialing again cause I'm past hangry now. I press 1 I'm not a business owner but I am sure as the sky is blue having my say. So I get through and I said this is completely unacceptable and rabbit down that phone like I was ready to say heads will roll. I get told I am refunded £18 they aren't refunding me in full cause of charges aren't refundable. There is no talk of a voucher or anything for my wasted time and money. Absolutely disgusting. I ordered my meal at 6ocklock from a 2 minute walk down the road but I'm thinking say safe cause of the virus order in,my food comes over an hour and a half later unedile korma had an oily layer on it was cold, chips were chewy like they had been regeated and the cheesecake like scrambled egg. This was clearly because everything was left in the bag too long. And the way the man spoke to me like don't expect your money back when I am a loyal customer never having a complaint before was despicable. He was acting above me and neither wonder because just eat clearly only care about the business side of things not the customer as I spent most of my night having to fight tooth and nail for my money back and now even still I give my time to try and make people aware not to use this service and go through the distress I have. I haven't even eaten anything since because I was treated like I was stealing my money back. I didn't even get my full money refunded and my bank is not showing the money yet. Please  please do not use just eat they have not got good customer service in place and you could be left with no meal and no refund as the shop will just say contact justeat they have the money and just eat will try to act like your taste buds are the problem. I was 4 hours of my night in total and left with no meal and a word of a refund that I have still to recieve in my bank account. Heads will roll if its not there by the time the full amount I paid goes through. Its still a pending payment to them, so this may correct itself on Monday. But I paid 21 pound odd and only getting 18 odd back so I paid for a night ruined unable to eat from then and we are now at half 2 the next again day. Just unacceptable.

There were many failures with this delivery service. 1. The driver was reluctant to drive to my flat door after I let him in through the security barriers. 2. After being rude to me on the phone whilst at barrier,  he and a female pulled up outside my flat. 3. He did not maintain any social distances and did not have a food bag which drivers usually leave on the floor so the customer can retrieve once they step away. 4. Driver just came over and handed a KFC bag and can of fizzy drink which I was absolutely shocked by. Later I had walked away and entered the flat entrance I discovered that the bag had been ripped in three places and that the food was exposed. The KFC security strip had remained untouched. I have made a complaint to Just Eat and made KFC aware of this issue. However due to being in a pandemic situation I will be contacting  the police and getting advice on steps so this driver cannot do this to other people.

They do not care about making you wait. You will probably die before you get your food. Plus, they will still charge you full price for it! Seeking a tasty meal on valentines for the whole family, my sister ordered an £84 dinner at 17:45. She waited from 17.45 until 20:30 for a driver to be assigned. Heavily frustrated, she used the just eats help chat multiple times, but they repeatedly stated: "" it would be a 15-minute wait to assign a driver"". What a pack of lies. Then, she spoke to Stella Marina, who was incredibly unhelpful (I think my nan could have been of more use and she’s dead). Stella just told my sister to wait for 15 minutes again and again. Abruptly, Stella left the chat and the order changed to delivered. It had never been delivered! We panicked, tried to get an answer to this, but it took them ages to reply to my sister's messages. We felt like we were going to lose our money and get no food. I guess this is how Iran felt when they order tanks from the UK, paid for them, but they never arrived. After two hours and half of waiting and useless chatting, they managed to assign a driver. We asked for money off, but just eats told me as they had assigned a driver, we would lose 50% off if my sister cancelled. That was a kick in the teeth. Sorry, we cannot deliver your order on time, its two and half hours late, plus you are starving, but we will steal half your money and make you stressed. They were not even apologetic. Like a serial killer, they showed no remorse. This placed us in a difficult position. After, two and a half hours our family was starving. We wanted our food. We did not want to lose £40. So, we did not cancel because who wants to lose half their money? In the end, we waited forever for the food and it arrived at five to nine! Funny, as they said it would arrive at 18.10.

I ordered a Pizza Hut delivery Saturday afternoon. After 5 minutes of the order being place, it was marked as collected and on its way. Alarm bells started ringing, as, how could 3 pizzas be built and cooked? I thought that maybe a miracle had occurred and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Nothing arrived after an hour. Contacted Just Eat but got a generic, useless bot through their ""chat"" feature. I then called Pizza Hut who informed me that they wanted to get in touch with me but Just Eat refused to give any contact details (fair enough with the data protection act I suppose), as the Just Eat driver had marked my order as collected and delivered but the driver had not turned up at the restaurant. They asked Just Eat to warn me of this but they didn't. It's now Friday after countless unfuitful chats and calls with agents that can't do anything for you, still no refund, although I have just been informed (after yet another call) that a full refund has been issued. I just have to wait and see if this is true as I have zero faith in this company. This is by far the worst experience I have had with a take away delivery service. So frustrating and disappointing.

The restaurant were unable to assign a delivery driver so the order was cancelled. Just Eat tell me that they have issued an immediate full refund that should arrive back in my account within 20 minutes. That didn't happen. Instead the transaction was debited with my bank and after multiple attempts to chase this up with Just Eat (offering to show them my bank statement to prove this) they simply said ""Your transaction would not be on your statement as when the refund was issued JustEat wouldn't have accepted the payment and therefore would be returned to you. The refund would not show up on any bank statements"". Okay? So why is that order amount debited on my statement? I contacted my bank twice giving them the apparent ""refund reference number"" and HSBC told me twice no such refund was made and JustEat did confirm the payment and had taken it after it was in a pending state. So JustEat are liars, theives and have broken the law. I have began talks with my solicitor in regards to this. I have also had an issue where some of my order was missing and again, was offered a partial refund that never actually showed up in my bank account. This company is a scam. Beware.

Awful customer service","I'm a regular customer and have previously had issues in terms of them resolving sincere customer complaints. Last night I saw that the delivery driver with our order was 'nearby' for a good 20-25 minutes. I assumed they were lost but no one got in touch with me to ask for directions. I then rang just eat to try and make contact with the driver/restaurant. While on hold to just eat i had a missed call from a mobile - when i tried to return the call i was not able and they never rang again. The driver then marked the delivery as 'delivered' even though it had not been. The just eat employee on the phone ( i accept it was not her fault, simply following very poor customer policy) then told me that because it was marked 'delivered' they would need to investigate it which could take up to 48 hours. I asked if there were other options to speak to someone senior in the team - as I now had nothing delivered and was out the money - and was told i could escalate to their manager but that this would take up to 72 hours. Their customer service is horrendous - in spite of being a regular customer I can't rely on getting my money back on an occasion when I received no food. And there is no option to resolve quickly. I'm lucky to be in a position where I could afford to place a new order (this time via deliveroo) but I imagine it would have been awful if it happened to someone who couldn't afford to do so, until the refund had been processed. This is unacceptable. I will be moving to use deliveroo only and will be avoiding just eat.",2021-01-25 09:35,{1: 'Bad'}

I recently got a voucher for JustEat, however, and decided to give them another chance.  What a mistake!  I made an order, albeit to the wrong address, but I ordered 6 hours in advance.  Plenty of time to cancel and make the same order again!  So I called up and asked them to cancel it as I wanted to change the address on it, but wait, the lady on the phone assured me that she was able to change the address on the order and there was no need to cancel and that the order would, indeed, be coming to my address.  Great news!  I was a little nervous though so I contacted them on their online chat about an hour later to ask if the address was really changed on the order.  I was assured for the second time that the address had been updated and that the order should turn up at my address.  So instead of cancelling and reordering, I let them tell me that the address on the order had changed.  6 hrs later, I'm waiting for the order.  It doesn't arrive. It gets marked as delivered. Turns out it still went to the original address.  I don't understand why they bothered telling me that they were able to change the address when they clearly weren't and then wasting my money instead of letting me cancel and reorder it.  What a waste of time.  Then I tried to contact JustEat about this and it went to their ""Investigations Team"", who then emailed me 2 days later with a blank email.  Great.  Contacted JustEat again, and again it went to their Investigations Team.  Now 4 days later (cited to take 2 days) - I've heard nothing from them.  She clearly told me it was passed back to the Investigations Team because she didn't want to deal with me anymore.  Amazing customer service, well done.Edit: Well the timing seems somewhat interesting, I sent them another email and then left this review and then they sent me a refund so I've upped my rating but considering how much hassle this has caused me, it's not going any higher until I see some actual better service",2021-01-14 19:08,{2: 'Poor'}

AVOID!Food not delivered for over an hour after arrival time was sent (well over hour & half after local order), phoned actual restaurant who said no one had collected and ""yes of course food is already cold"" and np idea when it would be delivered!  Then i phoned Just Eat customer service, after first being hung up on before talking to anyone the next assistant said they could not refund me until my delivery arrived and so I must call back when the food arrived if it was cold, which we all already knew it was, and she had no idea when it may be delivered either! Eventually food arrived nearly 2 hours after ordering, driver said he was 2nd driver and had no idea why no one had arrived before. Food was cold obviously.I phoned again and got through to another operator, who hung up on me when he heard it was a complaint!Called again and got a different person again, who spoke entirely from script like a robot, he eventually said that he would refund a maximum of £20. BUT my order was for £35. to start with, let alone any compensatory credit to apologise etc for now being starving over 2 hours later with no food or money back.He repeated and repeated and repeated that he could not refund me and that I could not speak to a supervisor or manager for 72 hours! and that there was no supervisor there at all!Eventually after about 30 minutes, as i would not hang up and held my ground about the theft of my money, he said a supervisor would call back in 10 minutes!  Oh he insisted he was in a call centre in the UK by the way...Surprisingly I did receive a call back & the very friendly woman sounded genuine but still would only give £20 back with £5 as credit to have to spend on scamming Just Eats again so only useable if giving them more money, total scam. She said she could only give £20 back maximum whatever amount an order had cost and they would not refund delivery fees or added costs at all as they had delivered, even though they had failed to collect the food when it was ready and all of the above etc. I could literally hear dogs barking in the background and quite amazingly Cockeralls crowing! - she confirmed that they are based in Asia but couldn't say where because she wasn't allowed and shouldn't be going of script at all, her tone of voice and inflections etc implied that she was exasperated and ashamed of the responses she clearly has had to give a LOT! And the non refunds. Anyway Just Eats have stolen half the cost of my order, not delivered edible food, made me have to spend an hour & half on the phone on 6 seperate phone calls! Wasted 3 hours of my day and meant i couldnt do work i was supposed to do as a result and forced me out into the supermarket for food in the pandemic.Cheers for all that....Great first experience with them.

When I got home, I realsied that the delivery time would be too late to eat. I rang the restaurant to check if they'd started my order, and they hadn't. So I went to JUST EAT www to cancel. However, I was only given two options; to continue or cancel but have half of the cost of the order taken - in this instance it totalled - £18.20. After cancelling, I instantly went onto chat to explain that they weren't justified in taking half the cost as I had checked with the restaurant first. I waited for nearly 90minutes to chat to someone - but the numbers went up and down and then eventually I was told they had closed the chat. I then tried to call their landline, and was sent on a loop to then be cut off - this happened several times that evening, and the next day, and the day after that. I rang the restaurant back, they confirmed that they had received my order on NYE and also said that they would not receive a penny of that 50% cancellation fee. So, this seems a major con, and I would appreciate advice as to how I can report them, as I believe this to be not only extremely bad practice but also scam/fraud-like! I have tried to resolve this with JUST EAT - but they are ignoring me, and each time I go back onto to chat I am told to wait to wait for an email response.

Unfortunately I put the wrong email address on for the lucky recipient (we all love free food and looking down at myself a little too much 🐽) yeah so anyway, my fault, I openly admitted the mistake, so I quickly purchased another and got my magnifying glass out and put the right one on, Great, worked a treat. So I try to contact them via there live chat, again pretty straightforward until drumroll 🥁 🥁 🥁 THEY BOOT ME OFF WHEN I MENTION A REFUND. This happened not once, not twice, not three, not four but five times, five times, again Five times!!! Uno dos tres quatro cinqo. Very rude advisors that swayed from the issue and they took me for a bit of a ride around the just eat roundabout. I gave up on the live chat, headed straight to my best mate resolver, on Xmas day of all days, I get a reply, again they do not understand the issue, that is until I ask for a manager to call me back immediately to resolve. The next day, yes boxing day, at 9am I get a call from just eat. I sharply answered, again the complaints advisor had no idea what had gone on 😭 (will to live lost at this point) , after a further explanation I was promised my refund, within 2 hours of that call, my refund was in my bank. Every advisor I spoke too, promised me the chat transcript from the live chats, not one transcript arrived, I have screenshots after chat 1 because my faith was shot to pieces, and in black and white, 'do you promise to send me the chat transcript after this convo!?' JE 'yes you will receive', chat ends by them booting me as I persist for a manager to enter the chat....... computer says NO, not one chat transcript recieved 🙄. It was a very straightforward query that they turned into a freddy kruger nightmare. I got my money back but I feel that I was very very very lucky to awake from it with my hard earned coin.

Silver linings for Sandra as my craic is second to none.Sandra thanks you justeat, I find you rude, obnoxious, don't listen and very very devious in your ways for a refund. Don't get trapped in the nightmare, call the restaurant up, save yourself the 0.50p service charge and make a new friend like Sandra. 👫Small update. Get signed upto resolver, it's free and you will get your money back as it gets logged with trading standards so they don't have a chicken leg to stand on. Pardon the pun. 🤟",2021-01-02 01:56,{1: 'Bad'}
JustEat,5fefc6b9755dc107e0d4c0e7,5fefc6b4ce9f9700193fbf3d,Legal robbery,More often than not I've had missing items. More often than you can't get hold of Just Eat and when you do they either can't speak English or lie. They promise refunds that you never receive. These type of companies should be illegal because they blame the restaurant who blame them. So the customer runs round in circles and eventually gives up. Someone is getting rich on slave labour and charging customers when no goods are delivered. Will not associate with Just Eat ever again. It's pot luck.

We chose them over Uber Eats due to their lower delivery fees.However this was a big mistake. The App stated a delviery time for 7:12pm which seemd odd at the time, later revised t 7:14pm.When the order was running approx. 20 minuteslate I contacted Just-Eat via the app. I was concerned that the food would turn up cold. Their Cutomer Support team put me on hold and were unable to locate the delivery and they told me to contact them again in 15-20 minutes if the order still hadn't turned up.20 minutes lates I contacted them and they were still unable to locate or contact their driver and offered us a £5 credit on our account which didn't nearly cover the cost of the order. I asked for a full and immeidate refund, we were very hungry and angry at this point. They proceeded to send what can only be described as robotic/scripted responses and certainly didn't come across like tney cared either way. No refund was offered.My boyfriend then contacted them half an hour later. The delivery was now well over an hour late. He asked for a full and immediat refund and was told the order had been ""rejected"" by us! After explaining the above situation (again) we asked for a full investigation & refund as it was clear the driver was not telling the truth and we were still not offered a refund.In the end they told us to wait for an email (no email has been sent a day later as I write this). They also promised an investigation would happen with a decision within 48 hours. When we checked the order later that evening the status on their app had beem updatd to ""delivered at 7.41pm!"".  I then called their Helpdesk at 9.25pm and was able to briefly speak to an agent who was sympathetic but couldn't help and just re-iterated we would have to wait for an ""investigation"".So essentially we have paid for food, it never showed up and now we are currently out of pocket with no expectation of a refund.

He said he would investigate but we would  not get our food, he also said the drivers don't work for just eat they work for KFC so he could not contact the driver to find out where he had delivered our food to, this to me was a ridiculous excuse to give.As  both me and my husband are diabetics we had to have our meal so we jumped in the car and went to the KFC the meal was ordered from. I explained what had happened and the manager phoned Just eat. While she was on the phone the driver turned up and said he delivered the order, I said to him you did not deliver to me or my husband, he agreed to that showed me a photo on his phone where he had delivered to a property in Venmore street which is 3 streets away from me. He said that was where the GPS took him to which means he obviously put the wrong post code in,even a change of just 1 letter can send him to the wrong address. But as my full address was on the bill he should have checked that before handing out food to someone else. I seriously think you should retrain your staff and drivers.KFC however know how to treat their  customers.

And the compensation for deciding effectively taking someone's dinner away fron them is non existant. My wife and I work long hard hours and she cares for her mother. We finally got to sit down at the end of a long day and catch up and share a meal. Our McDonalds was prepared, a driver selected and after waiting half an hour on 2 mcdonalds meals from one mile away, it was reported as being cancelled with no explanation. Just like that. So now Just Eat had decided we were not eating tonight worse still I had to call your customer service line to find out why as if  I was not already owed an explanation. Not good enough. It was at this point it became evident your customers are not important. After failing to carry out the sole service you provide, cancelling 2 tired and hungry peoples dinner that night you could offer nothing but a refund. At that stage and that late in the evening a refund is about as helpful as a delivery company who can't deliver fast food less than 1 mile away in half an hour. To find out the reason for the cancellation only proved to incense further. How can it still be possible that a company of your size and time  in business make it possible, to order from a restaurant that has closed for the night? No warning. No prior checks made. Just a half hour wait and abrupt abandonment of duty of care and service to your customers. And all for my money back. Where does that leave me at 11.30pm on a sunday? Utterly useless. Not only will I not be using this service again but actively advising people steer clear. For a company  that is meant to make ordering food easier, you've proved the opposite and that the best way is go and get it yourself as you can't be trusted.

It is now 72hour after the order and so Just Eat now say ""Take it up with the restaurant"". Just Eat are honestly Useless. Don't waste your money with them They have DISGUSTING Business practices and just mess you around. They allow the restaurants to wait 48hours before ""Completing Orders"" So they don't have to give refunds for awful food and poor service.

Just Eat refuse to contact the restaurant to request that the order is complete.Meanwhile, the App shows the order as delivered at my end... triggered by the restaurant - they’ve deliberately left the order incomplete at their end to avoid providing a refund because they know their service was awful.This loop of death means the restaurant can provide poor service without providing any recompense for dissatisfied customers.At peak times, they can continue taking orders, despite reaching their capacity, knowing full-well that their service will be compromised due to lack of resource and there’s no way for their customers to be refunded.Just Eat, change your process to empower your customers.  This will improve their service experience and ensure people return, making a sustainable model.

Just eat sent me message at 5:22 that food is on it’s way. I kept on waiting till 6 and then tried to contact just eat. There is no one to answer their call and website asked me to contact restaurant. The restaurant told me that I have to speak to just eat as the Food has been ready since 5:15. I kept on trying their number but no luck. I lost hope and went out myself to a nearby restaurant at 6:45 to buy food. As soon as I got home the driver turned up at 7:05. I refused to accept food and asked for refund and it’s a nightmare to claim. First of all chat box tries to resolve your matter for 15 minutes.(just a trick to waste time)Then the customer service person takes over and asks you to repeat your details and story again. And after going through all of that she told me that she can’t give me refund as the driver turned up at my house. Now it will go to some investigation department.(investigation for £18? I think they should contact FBI & MI5) This is clearly another tactic to delay or avoid refund. Any big company refunds straight away to avoid any bad name to their reputation but just eat didn’t even bother. My takeaway was only £18 but I wasted my 30 min just to claim that money.  What a joke. The amount wasn’t significant for me but there are a lot of people who are struggling and for them it can be a big thing. I would suggest you guys never to order through just eat. If you ring restaurant direct your prices will be cheaper as just eat takes certain percentage and you guys are paying for a ridiculous service.

I asked whether the supervisor believed £5 was adequate compensation for 2 hours of my time trying to resolve something that should have taken 2 minutes and the supervisor explained that was the best they could do. Only at this point did they formally cancel my order (more than 24 hours after it had been placed) I requested a callback from someone more senior as I didnt feel my complaint was being taken seriously (the error of their Bot and failure of two 'customer care' operators to deal with my issue) but was warned they couldn't do anything more.Manager called the next day and apologised again for something I had not complained about and offered the £5 credit. Again I asked the same questions and once again, they avoided taking responsibility for their mistake costing me 2 hours of my time to rectify. To ensure my complaint was taken more seriously, I requested a call back from someone more senior.They failed to make that call. I was sent an email to once again apologise for something I had not complained about.Moral of the story, this company seem to be eager to shift the blame onto the restaurants rather than admit to their own shortcomings and then suppress your complaint instead of acknowledging the issue.

Placed an order using the app,the restaurant confirmed the order and gave a 50 min time frame so at 1:03am got a message saying the order was on it's way so I live a 10 minute walk from the restaurant. To meet the time frame estimate should reach me by 1:15am come 1:45am no order so I phoned the restaurant they said the driver was running a bit late and it would be at 2:20,so I said he's not picked the food up yet and the chap said don't worry I've cooked the food I said oh and hung up 5mins later phoned up again and said no cancel the order,it hadn't been delivered in good time so I am entitled to cancel under statutory law. The chap said ok,obviously he wasn't happy but that's not my problem,he told me I'd have to contact just eat for a refund. I contacted them the next day when I got the order number I noticed the app had my order as delivered,I don't know if the restaurant has any interaction with the app as far as marking the order as delivered or not. If they do then they marked it as delivered out of spite. This is where it gets really sketchy I contact customer services first you go through a chat but then the chat but puts you through to an agent while trying to get my refunded and going through the convoluted process I would be dealing with one agent and while I'm typing the agent asks if there's anything else they can do and drops out so I then get bounced onto someone else so you have to start again and control your anger at how long the process is  taking so I left the chat,had a cuppa and phoned them. The person I spoke to had a thick Philippino accent so was abroad and scripted,which they stick to they said the complaint would be handed to their investigation dept and they would get back to me in 48 hours. Of course they didn't back on the chat same rigmarole a little bit more progress,I had to point out that under UK law I'm entitled to my money back and demanded a refund they then inform me they are unable to do so,it would have to go back up the chain and I would have to wait a further 72hours. Every CS agent kept pointing out that the order was marked as delivered,basically calling me a liar. I don't know if the delivered  is applied automatically or the restaurant is responsible but that is not my problem. My contract is with just eat they take the money so I have met my side of the contract just eat is in breach of their contract for not dealing with my complaint and refunding me as swiftly as possible,I can't help but think the whole process is designed to frustrate the customer to the point of writing off the cost. Which in my case it was a grand some of £17.02p in these times which are hard that could feed me for three days so I'm not giving up. If the restaurant did mark my order as delivered then that's not good and just eat need to reprimand the restaurant. Either way just eat has lost me as a customer and I would strongly advise any new customers to try one of the newer apps or deal directly with the takeaway but most of them don't have provisions for automated payments and what with the lurgy cash is not wise. Just eat get half of the one star and the takeaway gets the other half,I get a sore finger and ear and zero respect as a customer from just eat oh and an untitled ticket sent via email,whatever that is and at least I can leave this review as a warning to others avoid just eat like the lurgy and if you do use them eventually,you will end up here and if you have had an identical experience then you know that you are not alone and I'm not a gammon.",2020-10-03 01:51,{1: 'Bad'}

I spent around 40 mins on the chat. The first 2 chat assistants ended the call before it was processed. I had to repeat myself 3 times before I got any joy.  They would not refund the order at the time said the order was out for delivery. I recieved no updates until 10.20pm to say once again the delivery was on its way. When the order came it was cold and not at a satisfactory quality so I refused to except delivery. I informed the assistant on the chat and she offered  a credit note and said it was as good as a refund. No it not. This break the consumer rights and trade description  law. I was given misleading information and the food was at a unsatisfactory standard. Totally unexceptable.

The food took 2 hours 45 minutes to deliver and when it arrived it was cold. I tried to speak with the restaurant (1 successful attempt out of 65) and was fobbed off with an excuse about traffic (even though there was none - food arrived at almost 9pm and roads were empty according to google maps). I spoke to the bot service who put me through to a live chat. I was told just eat can’t help and I need to speak with the restaurant. So I tried the restaurant one more time as requested of me, of course they hung the phone up. I went back to just eat and was told it’s down to the restaurant, they can’t help - even though I had followed every single step asked of me. I then asked for the complaints procedure and was completely ignore, the response was “you need to contact the restaurant”. I then asked again around 10 more times and did not receive an answer as to what their complaints procedure was or given a number/email etc. The service was absolutely shambolic.

I rang Just Eat to find out what was happening, after a long drawn out process I was finally put through to one of their customer service team, I explained what had happened and they told me what I already knew - the restaurant had marked it as delivered - though they also told me an investigation would be launched. A few days later I received an email telling me I would not be receiving a refund as they had checked their records and the restaurant marked it as delivered... I don't know if I need to point out why this is a problem. So a restaurant marks my order as delivered when it wasn't, I call and explain that, their ""investigation"" means simply asking the restaurant again? And what a surprise, the restaurant stuck to their lie. I was frustrated when I didn't receive my food, but I was really getting annoyed now, who wouldn't? Not only am I being refused a refund for food I didn't receive, I'm essentially being accused of lying and Just Eat have not put any effort into determining what is correct - their ""investigation"" is as lazy as they come. So I get in contact with Just eat again and explain all of this, I'm told they will look into my issue more thoroughly, sounds all good right? Today I get another email from them, the exact same email I received last time (word for goddamn word). What is the point in pretending you're going to deal with my issue if you're going to put such little effort into concealing the fact that you have done absolutely nothing? Do Just Eat just assume their customers are too stupid to realise? Or too lazy to persist? Nothing annoys me more than companies who take their customers for granted in this way, I order food occasionally out of convenience and thankfully it was just me on my lonesome this time, what if I was ordering for a family? I've been ordering from Just Eat for as long as I can remember, yeah I don't get a bucket in every week, but I've given them enough over the years and I've NEVER claimed food wasn't delivered to me. Welp what can ya do? The most annoying thing about this (and I take full responsibility for being duped twice) is that this all happened to me with Deliveroo! Both have terrible customer service, basically you're fine on 99.9% of your orders, but pray that a restaurant doesn't F you over because believe me, these guys will not lift a finger to solve it.",2020-09-25 09:14,{1: 'Bad'}

Not only was the order a hour and a half late, it was stone cold and the delivery driver made no attempt at an apology. She simply said that she did not speak English, shrugged her shoulders and walked off. I tried to request a refund and complain to Just Eat. What a joke! Seven different operators all asking me what the problem was with no solution, no refund, barely an apology and just talked nonsense at me for an hour! I asked how to get a card refund as I had no intention of ordering from them again and no one could tell me. Their site is ridiculous when it comes to a complaint as you just get passed through one 'call' to another and there is no direct way to request a refund anywhere! When I called Macdonalds they could not believe it had taken so long and told me that next time I visit the restaurant they would give me a free meal as a way of saying sorry. They were polite, apologetic and very professional. In comparison Just Eat said to leave a review for the restaurant and they would feed back to them how dreadful they were with no one wanting to share the blame etc. I am utterly appalled by the lack of customer service, empathy, helpfulness or regard for my two tired, hungry and tearful children who I had promised a treat to! In the end I had to cook for them otherwise they would not have eaten till late and would have had to go straight to bed!

Now you have absolute 0% chance of resolving anything with these 1diots.  They have become so incompetent over the last few years, customers (the people actually ordering the food) and their partners (which are the food establishments that provide the food) are finding it impossible to deal with this company. Avoid Just Eat,Uber Eats and Deliveroo  if you can because the food establishments will inevitably increase their prices or reduce their offers on these platforms to cover the costs. They can charge the restaurants anywhere between 20%-35%. If a food establishment has their own delivery service ringing them directly or using their website will normally be cheaper. Food Hub is another good option at the moment (they charge the restaurants 0% commission) so they should be able to give better deals on this platform. One thing is definitely for sure Just Eat is becoming a joke, but I suppose they had to cut some corners to give Snoop Dogg his 5 million.",2020-09-11 04:13,{1: 'Bad'}

They wont help if the order is wrong that your receive, if the driver was near your house at any point they treat it as a good delivery, which is rarely is if its involving their drivers. They put their own phone number on instead of the restaurant so you cant even speak to the place you order from in most cases. The drivers are the worst ive ever experienced in any delivery service, making out they are collecting your food when they are nowhere near and likely wont even both to pick it up no matter how long you wait.

Maybe time to stop spending so much money on advertising for new customers and actually look after the ones you already have/had.

Both restaurants were happy to give him a refund but he was told he had to through just eat as the payment was through just eat not the restaurant. He was told to send an email which he did but still no reply.Has contacted just eat since a few times. Still no refund these orders were over a month ago.

Not long after the order was made, I get a notification that the order was on its way. I tracked the delivery person via the app to make sure it went to the right place. As the tracker approached a nearby street near my house, I kept looking outside my window but saw no car or bike. Suddenly, I get a notification that the order has been delivered!! Surprised, I'm now outside my house trying to see if the driver has gone to one of my neighbours, but still saw nothing. So I got onto customer service only to get told the delivery has been made and there is nothing they can do! They said they'd get back to me within 72 hours. Angry and frustrated, I hung up my phone, I looked out of my window to see a woman and a young girl I don't recognise, holding a KFC bag and a bottle of drink coming towards my house!! Sure enough, the woman knocks on my door and hands me my order. She tells me she lives in the next street over. It was nice of the woman to walk on over to me with my order (though I am not altogether sure why she accepted it), however, the order was cold AND the seal was partially ripped. So, not only can the driver not read the address, not only is customer service utterly dismal, but in a time of the pandemic, when you want your food touched by as few people as possible (with respect to the woman), my order has now been passed through at least two hands before it has reached me, and cold!

The meals were freezing cold I tried to take the burgers out of the buns to warm them mess everywhere with sauce the fries were ruined I ate about half a dozen, funny enough the milkshakes were warm, lol warmer than the food tasted horrible so binned the bloody lot of them.I like to give positive reviews but there is no way I can with this order. I said Just eat have bitten of more than they can chew they haven't got enough delivery staff to cover the new contracts.I will use Uber eats next time at least previous food arrived early and hot.

As a big fan of KFC, I was shocked to hear this - what an attitude?!!During this discussion with JustEat's cancellation team, the driver eventually arrived - 22 minutes later - 19:22 - at which I informed him it was cancelled.He shouted - ""sorry mate!""And only when I then pressed my point to JustEat that I was ""not at fault"" and provided evidence i.e. map, txt message, etc they then went onto say that it was not JustEat's fault as they use a ""third-party drivers""?!Now some of you out there may be saying ...""As the driver had eventually arrived, I COULD have taken the order ...""Sure, I could have but with me, this is all that's wrong with this country, we never complain about poor services!And as this example proves, JustEat thinks more of it's ""vendors"" than that of us, the customers.I DON'T REWARD POOR SERVICE!Now you may be thinking I was a tad harsh?But looking at TrustPilots reviews (which I wished I had done so beforehand rather than listen to the BS Adverts) I would have discovered the 87% negative reviews of JustEat!Needless to say and knowing what I now know, I will be steering well clear of JustEat in the future!!CC to KFC - hello (at) kfc.co.uk",2020-08-12 10:34,{1: 'Bad'}

It is now 10.35 pm and still no order - 30 mins of the phone complaining and the delivery time just kepps being moved.  It's 10.40pm now.  I am diabetic and need to eat regularly to keep my sugar levels correct.  This episode has literally made me ill and when I asked for comepensation I was told they woud compensate me I was told I could have a full refund only if I cancel my order!  The lady I spoke to on the phone was doing her best but to be told that the first driver just decided not to do the delivery was a complete insult. I felt I didn't matter as a customer at all.

Ordered a pathia, yet a complete different tasting dish arrives. The restaurant blamed just eat saying they have described the dish incorrectly so I need to get in touch with them. I notify just eat, they say they will get in touch with the restaurant. 15 days pass and still no response from just eat. I email them again, they now ask me for my details due to data protection laws which they did not ask me the first time round. Did they not even bother looking into the case the first time around? I pass over my details and they respond a day later saying there is nothing they can do. I check the restaurant and notice that the description on the just eat menu is still incorrect. Not only are they refusing to refund my dish they didn't even bother to get the description changed on the menu. I have been using just eat weekly for over five years, not any more. I see many other people are having problems with their lack of customer care also. I do not see how they will survive as a business if they continue at this rate.",2020-08-11 17:35,{1: 'Bad'}

I contacted them on chat where, like others, I was referred to an investigations team where the response would be 48 hours. After 48 hours and hearing nothing I went back on chat, they apologised and said they would chase it up - but could ultimately achieve nothing. I registered a complaint, and was told I'd be contacted withing 24 hours. After another 24 hours, I still haven't heard back - I'm over trying to get it back, it's clearly some off-shore call centre that don't really know what they're doing. So I remove all my cards and try to delete my account, but you can't. You can only deactivate it from the 'My Account' page, and they say they keep some of your info on file..I went on chat to see how I could go about deleting my account, they said it would take 30 days and involve going through security. I'm not sure what security they were proposing, I'd recently changed my account name to Mandango Fandango with an address of something like; Just Eat has terrible customer service Road. So I doubt I'd have passed this 'security' Looking at the other reviews, it does seem like they've outsourced this to somewhere that is taking advantage of it to take data from JustEat users. It's also slightly worrying that they just accuse people of lying about not receiving deliveries rather than looking at their drivers.

I have never had any problems with them in the past however a few weeks ago I had a restaurant call me repeatedly asking me to change my review of their service which I think I seriously unacceptable. Then today I ordered food which never made it. The driver arrived and found our buzzer not working (which I didn't know about as I use the back door only so didn't write in the notes section) the driver phones me twice within a minute which I didn't answer as my phone was on silent. I called back asap and was met with the message 'incorrect number'. I looked out of the window to see the driver was still there so grabbed my shoes to go catch him. When I got downstairs he wasn't there so I tracked him on the app to see he was on his way back to the restaurant. I called just eat and was told they couldn't deliver the food again (I was given no reason why they couldn't) and I could only have a 50% refund because the restaurant has already used electricity to make the food. I even tried calling the restaurant and they said they hadn't had any food returned. So the food can't be delivered but hasn't made it too the restaurant... so who is eating my food???

We ended up calling the restaurant at about 8:15pm and because the order hadn't moved at all on the app. After chasing several times (the restaurant didn't know where their delivery driver was and could not get in contact with him) our order finally arrived at 8:50pm which was close to 2 hours after we had originally ordered. The delivery driver just dropped our food at the door and didn't check to see if it was the right house which is incredibly unprofessional. Every time I spoke to the restaurant, the person I spoke to kept interrupting me which was very rude. The food was all cold when it arrived except for the drink which was hot. The chips were terrible, tasted completely like cardboard and we didn't end up eating them. We asked for a refund and proceeded to chase them for a week for this which still hasn't been received. Considering the name of the restaurant is Speedy's, this could not have been more inaccurate as neither the food, delivery driver or refund have been speedy. Just Eat was also incredibly unhelpful throughout the entire process and refused to process the refund despite agreeing to it a week earlier. They kept saying that the restaurant would have to do this from their end however the restaurant had apparently called them and was told that I would have to process for a refund.So unimpressed about the service, delivery, quality of food and handling of my enquiry.",2020-07-02 16:29,{1: 'Bad'}

Phoned just eat to see what could be done. Either reorder and pay delivery again for 1 item or a credit refund. I don't use just eat often at all so this is pointless. There should be a system in place to help this. Either call the restaurant and do redelivery or if the person can go out which would be pointless because delivery is so you don't have to go out. Also you should be able to refund back to customer card. You would be able to see on their account if they constantly requesting refunds and then issue credit.

I suggest anyone this happens to does the same. Search JustEat CEO email online and you'll find it.Dear Mr Duffy,I have had a serious issue with a wrong delivery made today and I’m very unhappy with how the staff were actively unhelpful with the situation.I placed an order with JustEat today and when the driver came, I realised right away that the order was wrong. The driver and I stood at my door while he contacted your staff and I tried to call the restaurant.  I couldn’t get through to them so the driver advised me to speak to Customer Service online chat and they would be able to fix it.  I told him to take the order back because it was not what I wanted and was no use to me, I assume someone else went without or received a wrong order as well.I spoke to the customer service team and their only response is it will be investigated and I’ll hear back within 72 hours.  I asked them to replace the order or refund me so I could place it again but they just kept saying it needs investigating.  I don’t have any money to place a new order and I won’t get my money or order from JustEat for at least 48-72 hours. I will go hungry tonight because of this.  I asked the staff to help me out, I suggested could they put credit on my account so I can reorder but all I got was ‘sorry we can’t do that, it has to be investigated’.  I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor and was told no-one was available and I’d have to wait.  I don’t understand that.  I even asked the staff member if there were supervisors present in the office they are based, the answer was yes but for some reason I still was not allowed to escalate it.  I was made to feel like you don’t believe me when I say what happened and now I have to wait 3 days for someone to decide whether I should get my money back or not!I don’t see why an investigation is needed to be honest.  Your own driver told them it was a wrong order at the exact time it was being delivered and took it away again.  After I had no luck with your online staff, I tried the restaurant again and when I got through explained the situation.  They said the driver had never returned with an order and it was likely they just kept it or threw it out.I’ve provided my order and complaints references below.  I’m fully aware that you might not receive this message in enough time to do anything about it right away but I really need this to be fixed ASAP because I don’t know what I’ll do tonight.  What I do know is I won’t be using JustEat again after this.  I must use the service at least 2-3 times a week and have never had any problems until today, and the first issue that comes up no-one is willing to try and help.  I just can’t believe that I wouldn’t be given an immediate refund or replacement when I didn’t receive my order.  If I’d called the restaurant directly and the wrong order arrived, it would be resolved right away.  If I’d done it through Deliveroo, they would refund instantly or credit my account so I could place it again.I received a response the next day as follows:""Jason.C (Just Eat UK)28 Jun 2020, 11:39 BSTHello PaulMy name is Jason and I work in the Investigations & Escalations department and your query has been passed to me by the executive team to review.I'm very sorry to hear that your order was not delivered and an incorrect order was delivered to you instead. Unfortunately this does seem to be a common issue however these issues need to be investigated thoroughly and professionally.I can see that you are unhappy with waiting up to 72 hours for us to investigate, this is just a time period that our advisors give to our customers, however these may not take 72 hours and we can sort these queries rather quickly depending on the volume of our requests. Unfortunately we would need to investigate these situations and we cannot just give you a refund without proof.I'm happy to confirm that I have processed a refund for the affected items for you, this is for £9.64. The funds will return to your account within 3-7 working days.I'd like to reassure you that Just Eat takes matters like this very seriously and we will be sharing your feedback with the delivery company directly to ensure that they take action with the driver.In future, please may I ask that you provide photographic evidence of the incorrect order with the receipt clearly showing. I have refunded you on this occasion as you did not know however, this is a new policy and I cannot guarantee another refund in future.We apologise for any inconvenience caused, please let me know if you require any further questions or assistance and I will be more than happy to help.""However to date, 16 July, I've still not received my refund.

So I called just eats customer service again and explained the situation. Paul (the customer service) then repeatedly lied to me saying it was not their drivers, and then said that he has contacted the driver through telephone. I asked if he could call the driver, and Paul responded that he couldn’t because he had not been able to contact him. So I am back in square one after being repeatedly lied to, asked to speak to the manager. Paul then lied and said the manager will contact me. However the manager has not, and just eat are very sneaky for not providing an on-site manager and have just ignored my complaints. I am now down £23, just eat are also very sneaky for not hanging up the phone for me to do a review of the service, and put me on hold for about 20 minutes.

So the restaurant cancelled my order the next day so 2 star review wouldn't be posted and thus wouldn't affect their restaurant ratings and since I paid in cash they won't refund. So any restaurant can decide to cancel the order if the customer has paid in cash and left them a bad review. So I suppose the ratings don't mean anything since the restaurant can control to an extent what reviews can be left for them.

Low and behold both orders were accepted at the same time.Immediately i called the restaurant who said they were happy to not provide the justeat order and if I call them they can cancel the order as they cant remove orders from their machine in the restaurant. You would think this would be a relatively easy thing for justeat to do right? Wrong!! 3 days of bickering with them and I gave up trying to receive my £25 back.

There was clearly an issue with the app so I decided to try again at 4pm. I went through again to the payment stage and it said the same thing that the restaurant was closed but then it took me though payment and used a different card this time which went through however I received 2 emails with two order numbers both coming through at the same time. When I tried to cancel one of the orders I was directed to a chat and holding on for some time. When I did get through on the chat and talk with someone, they were arragont and rude telling me it's my fault!!I asked them to cancel one of the orders but they said that it's too late to cancel as the restaurant is already preparing the food....what??It hasn't left the restaurant, I just wanted it cancelled but he them said I would have to pay 50% cancellation charge as it's short notice!!This was getting more pathetic!!I made a complaint through Resolver and I got a computer generated response which didn't answer my complaint or how I would get my refund.With the issue of lack of funds at the moment as I cannot work, I can't afford to lose £26.98.

The delivery driver called me as instructed so I could meet him at the front gate, ""he was struggling to find my location"". After a 15-minute phone call of back and forth, I assume he had enough of trying to find me and hung up! I tried calling him back as I thought he just got disconnected, no answer. After several attempts, I got fed up and decided to call the restaurant. The guy I spoke to informed me that the food had left just before 1 pm and all the delivery drivers work for just eat, not the actual restaurant, he advised me to call just eat. I decided to talk to Just Eat Via the app, First a BOT and secondly a real person. Never in my life have I come across such a condescending and patronizing person, they first offered me a partial refund of 50% to cover the costs of the restaurant making the food ""still hadn't arrived, it was 1:45 pm at this point"" Much lunch break was over. I explained even if the food does arrive I will not have time to eat it as I have to go back to work so I will require a refund. At this point, I was offered a £5 voucher because my food was late and was advised to give them a further 5 - 10 mins, I wasn't best pleased with this outcome as I had to go back to work and I felt I clearly wasn't being listened to. It all felt a bit scripted. More back and forth messages were exchanged and easily 15 minutes had passed. ""STILL NO FOOD"". I was told to wait a further 20 minutes. Completely fed up I ended the messaging and decided to wait a little bit and try talking to someone else. I got through to someone else and they were happy to cancel my order "" so I wouldn't get charged"". I was pleased with this outcome until the person I was speaking to said they couldn't process a refund as I have accepted £5 credit on my account! I specifically said I didn't want the £5 I just wanted my money back as goods were not received, I felt this first-person did this intentionally to hinder my refund. At this point, I was at my wit's end and was begging for my money back so I could go back to work so I wouldn't get in trouble with management. The person I was speaking to had the cheek to ask am I willing to still wait for the food, I actually couldn't believe they asked me that. Around 2:45 Just Eat agreed to cancel my order and that I wouldn't be charged. I was told my balance would take between 15 and 20 minutes to receive the funds "" I know those two statements do not make sense, that's what I was told.

I was then sent an email with a complaint number and told to reply with a detailed explanation and some photos, which I did. I should probably mention that by this point I had given up enough of my time to deal with the matter, however this would prove fruitless as after many ridiculous and illogical email exchanges Just Eat refused to offer anything in the way of actual help at all. They manage to write long, fluffy nonsensical emails without actually saying or doing anything. The photos clearly supported the written claim (eg a special fried rice with prawns, chicken and beef that was clearly plain boiled rice with some peas). Just Eat were also dumb enough to reply that 'the photos don't support your claim (regarding flavour)'.... Obviously photos cant really tell you much about flavour. Clearly getting a job as one of Just Eats' 'Investigations Team' doesn't require much in the way of logic, rationality, accountability, ability to use eyes, general abundance of brain cells.... I seriously wonder if just eat would have accepted any responsibility if the meal caused food poisoning to someone, or if they would have just referred to their 'T's and C's'.It's quite disgusting for a company to take so much and offer so little.

I had to go through FOUR people for 1 problem,"Here is my experience with Just Eat thus far: 1) ordered food from KFC last night. Driver spent 10 minutes driving in the wrong direction. After finally making his way in my direction, he called me at 8:29 to say he was on the street over. I advised that’s not where I’m located, gave directions and waited for him to show. Tried calling him at 8:46PM but the call wouldn’t go through. (The food was supposed to be delivered at 8:08)2) 8:52 and still no show (but it was marked as delivered at 8:29) so I called just eat for a solution. Explained to the representative the issue who put me on hold and came back to say the driver has been waiting for 30 minutes. She said I have his number and can call him and basically was telling me to sort it myself. I had to beg her not to hang up on me and explain I tried calling him but the number didn’t work. She found my number in their call logs, tried to call him and realised for herself that the number wasn’t working. I asked for a refund which I received immediately and the representative also offered a £5 credit for the inconvenience caused. At this point I was satisfied with the outcome as I got my money back plus credit. 3) Decided to use the credit from last night today but when going through checkout I don’t see the option so went to online chat.  Guada Marie told me try a different browser (didn’t work). Char Louis said my account is at £0 because I used the credit already. Explained it should have been credited last night and I haven’t ordered anything since. She disappeared for a while and then exited the chat because I rated it bad (she ignored my following messages asking if I would be credited). The final person I connected to (Kristel L) realised I never got the £5 credit added to my account and rectified this for me. It seems that Customer Service at this company is to throw the first solution and get rid of you rather than to listen to what the client has to say. This review could have been avoided if people just did their job properly. I’ll be sticking to Deliveroo and Ubereats from now on.",2020-05-11 13:30,{1: 'Bad'}

You should put in place to all that use your service that they can only accept a workable amount of orders. Ie no more than 25 to 30 in at any time.

Huge mistake!!  I should have taken time to read through the reviews elsewhere on other websites and would have seen just how awful the restaurant is.  Food arrived half an hour after the expected delivery time; it was stone cold; the portions for the main meals came in smaller-than-normal sized containers and were barely half full; tasteless and a complete waste of £50.  A lot of it went straight in the bin. The restaurant don't answer their phone.  JustEat washed their hands of the problem, with various excuses, finally saying the restaurant wouldn't approve a refund so hard luck.  They then terminated the online chat abruptly.  Really not sure of the benefit to the customer of using JustEat - pretty pointless as they deny responsibility for poor service. I will make sure that I don't use JustEat again. My one-star ratings apply to both the restaurant and JustEat.

It's just not worth putting more effort into trying to get my money back.

It wasn't the restaurant fault that the just eat driver took 10 minute to enter the building.  I'm fuming . And if I could I wouldnt even give them 1 star . Absolute joke . 34 minute on a phone to someone who couldnt speak proper English and wasted my time telling me I could have £20 refund I said I wasn't happy and 3 times I was put on hold for him to come back with the same dribble as before.  I won't be leaving this and will get a full refund even if i have to take it to the ombudsme. These big company's have no sense when it comes to customer services .",2020-01-15 20:22,{1: 'Bad'}

Nearly 2hours 30 mins later, we got our delivery and everything was stone cold.

The chicken burger was the same and chips were half raw still due to not being cooked properly. Contacted the restaurant and said it was just eat that was liable. We spent 5 hours on the just eat chat rooms and either the advisors ended the chat and disconnected it meaning we were back in queue 56 again, we were told wrong information or were ignored. We phoned the customer services and again after 2 hours on the call to different advisors, the manager then hung up on us after laughing about refunding us and clearly could hear him talking about us while he thought he put us on hold. We didn’t get any call back. Phoned the next day and got through to a nice advisor that understood and was able to confirm that we’d spoken to 15 advisors that had all disconnected chats, calls or told us wrong info therefore raised a complaint for us and got her manager to call us the next day to sort the refund and was told the full amount of 52.26 would be refunded. 2 weeks later the money wasn’t in my account and again had to go through the exact same process and dealt with either rude or sarcastic advisors that one said I was trying to rip them off to get my money again which is the worst service I’ve ever got, he called me a liar and hung the call up.

JustEat,5dfb7676c845450b7432a4eb,5dfb763631bb5a00968c46cd,Won't issue refunds,"I have used just eat for a while. Terrible company. I have no idea why I allowed restaurants to take 2 hours to deliver regularly. Many tend to mark the food as delivered before they would even be out for delivery. The introduction of the 50p ""service charge"" to circumvent the legislation against charging for card payments is a pretty low move. Isn't their cut from the restaurants enough? A cut that is always put on the customers. The last straw for me is when I ordered from Milano Pizza in Mile End, London. Their reviews also suggest an incompetent deliverer. They did not deliver and rudely refused to speak to me in regards to the missing order. They told me to handle it with just eat.Just eat were very unprofessional and merely told me they ""can't do anything about it"" and that they'll be ""investigating"". That was clearly a lie as they did not get back to me. I hardly believe they would ""investigate"" as it's the word of its customer against an incompetent driver which many reviewers also felt did not deliver if they felt it was inconvenient.  I regret giving all these five stars to terrible restaurants merely because I wanted to be nice. The cheek of one specific restaurant to always tell me to review 5 stars because I was a regular even after 3 hour delays. These restaurants who end up on just eat are the worst of the lot.",2019-12-19 13:09,{1: 'Bad'}

JustEat,5de0576bc845450ae41fca99,5de056f2f95c3cc4226d12a5,Did somebody say terrible customer service?,"Another terrible review.I ordered a takeaway just over 48 hours ago, after 20 minutes the restaurant called to say they gave the delivery driver the incorrect food. When the delivery driver arrived I confirmed he had the incorrect food (completely wrong) but the driver refused to take it back, telling me to ring the restaurant, the restaurant then said I needed to contact Just Eat to raise a ticket and get the order resent. So begins the wild goose chase.I initially contacted Just Eats online chat helpline, they told me I should ring the restaurant again, so I obliged and they again sent me back to Just Eat. Just Eat then said all they could do was give me a £20 refund (which was around 50% less then what I spent). I said I wanted to speak to a supervisor. I was told I would get a call within the hour. I waited up until nearly midnight and received no phone call. After work the next day I rang up and asked to speak to a supervisor and they said they were really sorry they didn't call and that they would within the hour. At this point I was understanding that it was late the night before and they may of just ran out of time the previous night. Well guess what, 2 hours pass and no call was made.I ring back and I am told it actually takes 24 hours for a supervisor to return their calls. I told them this isn't what I was told twice before and I would like to speak to one now. They insist that the policy is to ring back within 24 hours and I would get a call within backdated to my first request for a supervisor. They still didn't call me.I call back again and a different customer service agent tells me that he had asked his supervisor to call within the hour, and previously it was only raised in their system but now it was raised personally. I wait up until midnight and guess what, no ring. The next day after work I ring again. I ask to speak to a supervisor and she informs me that they are all in a meeting and she would get one to call back. She tells me that the supervisor won't be able to help me either as it is their policy to only refund £20 maximum. I had to hassle them for over 40 mins so that I was left on hold until the supervisor is out of the meeting. Up to this point they had continually reneged on their responsibility to provide adequate services and goods, tried to imply that it was solely the restaurants responsibility and ensured me that this was all they could do because it was 'policy'. I really hate being rude to people but I told them they would have to stop mentioning their policy because it was making me irate.The women from the Customer 'Care' Team then told me to not blame her for waiting on the phone for a long time to speak to her supervisor.It took a further 13 minutes, a fraction of the time I had been on the phone to this point, for her supervisor to come and talk to me. I asked if he could help me immediately and if he was able to refund me the full amount, he said no. But I went off on one telling him I wanted to speak to his supervisor, and if that meant I had to go all the way up to Peter Duffy (the CEO) I would. He quickly changed tact and said he would be happy to help me and then within 5 minutes he had told me they are going to refund the full amount and he was overriding their policy because I was a loyal customer.Apparently the refund will take up to 7 working days, which after reading some of the other reviews I have doubt I will receive. I've took a ticket number in case I have to chase up.I've used Just Eat plenty of times before but I have never had to deal with their woeful Customer Care Team before. It was shocking. I am going to avoid at all costs and I would suggest anyone who has to order from there to pay cash and not give in to the temptation of the convenience of card, because Just Eat pray on it.I would also suggest others in a similar situation to me persist on a full refund, continually bring up the Consumer Rights Act 2015 which gives us some protection, insist that you will take it to small claims court if you have to and demand to speak to the supervisor of who you are speaking with if they say they can't do anything for you. They can they've just got internal policies so consumers are defrauded out of their money. Sickening.",2019-11-28 23:25,{1: 'Bad'}

I did not get a callback.  I phoned again went through the whole thing and was promised a full refund (my order was for £24.08). I then received two emails one stating I would receive in total £20.96. I phoned back again and explained yet again what had happened and demanded to speak to a manager, I was put on hold for 40 minutes. I hung up and phoned back (10th in the queue) explained my complaint yet again and again demanded to speak to a manager, put on hold again for 20 minutes, hung up phoned back yet again, (19th in queue) explained again and was told they will refund the remainder but first she needs to see if the other advisor really promised a full refund (implying I was lying) Waited on hold, she came back and said it was not promised there’s nothing more they can do it’s not possible to refund the remainder I have to go to the restaurant to get the delivery and service charge refunded, explained contract law again and the fact that the driver is employed by just eat and not KFC they continued to refuse the full refund promised. I demanded to speak to a manger she stated the manager will tell me the same thing I asked repeatedly to speak to a senior manager (in excess of 50 times I asked) each time was refused she stated she spoke to her manager and has said the same thing in the end she agreed to have a manager call me back within 48 hrs, I argued this down to 2 hour callback, I confirmed the managers name that she had spoken to and told her I don’t want him phoning I want a different manager to call me.  Received call found out he was not a senior manager but a call Center supervisor and the “manager” I didn’t want the call from, he was as ignorant and rude as all the others, he again directed me to the restaurant I informed him I had spoken to them and as suspected they do not get the payment details, contact details or even the customers name and therefore cannot issue any refunds.  I demanded to speak to a senior manager and again was told they will tell me the same thing and my complaint has gone as far as it can. I continued to demand a callback and was promised a 24 hour callback.  I’m still waiting.  I have emailed the chief executive (google peter Duffy ceo just eat for his contact info they won’t allow me to post it here) directly with my formal complaint and this appears to be being ignored as there has not even been an acknowledgement of my complaint.

I am an app designer, marketer and business consultant and ordered food from JustEat this morning.Order number(814977297) Two and a have hours later after numerous phone calls to the restaurant and to JustEat (the restaurant whom happened to cook my food twice as their reputation would be on the line if they sent out soggy cold food which is wastage to them). I reckon after this fiasco the restaurant may drop JustEat.I told JustEat that my order had not arrived on multiple occassions after waiting to be connected more than 30 minutes each time and JustEat said systems were down with their third party drivers. I had no reply to my Tweet or to my FB message.Your pathetic excuse is frankly not my problem and seeing as I was late for appointmnets Just Eat should at least compensate me, not give me worthless £5.00 credit notes. What makes you think I will ever use JustEat ever again????????????????????What is stopping me building a bigger app and better service and taking away your business???????????????Furthermore I messaged the CEO of Just Eat and told him if I have lost business because of JustEat due to their incompetantance then it is only right that JustEat should loose business too.Trustpilot is only the start of what I can do.What is stopping me to spread my experience far and wide on all social media platforms and on my marketing blogs.I even asked for them to call an independant taxi company and they said it was against their policy and that their hands were tied.I would be extremely worried if I were in their shoes and most of my reviews were 1 star ratings. If I could give minus ten I would. What is stopping me marketing JustEat competitors like Deliveroo or UberEats free of charge just so that JustEat feels a dent in their business, considering I lost a customer because of them as they could not wait around for me.It will be interesting if JustEat respond to this but I am not holding by breath.",2019-10-31 16:23,{1: 'Bad'}

Absolutely fed up now and I won’t be using them again. Family and friends have heard all about my complaint as it’s just ridiculous how they’ve not bothered and had a customer on hold for this long.

The situation with the delivery mechanism they have chosen to implement is so confusing that I don’t even think either party (Nando’s or their delivery partner; Just Eat) have any communication between them and it almost feels like their UK CEO don’t have any idea that Just Eat are delivering on their behalf or that they even offer delivery at all, if they did they surely would have implements some simple service level agreements to ensure the following does not happen1. When I phoned up Nando’s to ask them to send the forgotten burger they told me that they can’t do anything and I need to call the delivery company to get it sorted out (we had just sat down to our meal, on what planet did they think I want to make a call, press 1 then 5 then 2 and then be put on hold for 5 minutes while my food is going cold?2. When I convinced the Nando’s staff member to make the call on our behalf as we didn’t mess up the order and it should not ruin everybody else’s meal we did not hear back from them for an hour, when we called we were told to call the delivery company again3. When we called Just Eat we were connected to a member of staff who claimed to be in “Canada” and kept telling me he “understands” but did not listen at all to what I was saying - I tried to explain it’s a simple solution, get one of the drivers to go to Nando’s, collect the forgotten food and bring it round, they said they can’t do that, so I asked if they could arrange for the food to be prepared and I would collect it which they said I would need to speak to the restaurant which annoyed me as I had waited for an hour and been on the phone now to JustEat for 10 minutes so I asked for a full refund as the whole experience has been ruined and I was told we can’t get a refund, I asked to speak to his supervisor which he refused to give me a name of or put me through he then decided to finally hang up on me, no doubt his supervisor was listening in on another headset and told him to do this (I have worked in a customer service call centre myself and know this happens)3. We called back Nando’s to see if they could make the burger and the sides again for that meal (as suggested by Just Eat) and I would go and pick it up which they said they can’t do and we need to speak to the delivery company.....Can you see why I was getting so frustrated???!!!In the end we got nowhere, don’t be fooled when we log onto the Nando’s website to place the order, it is just a rebranded JustEat site and the two companies seem to have no desire to communicate with each other to provide suitable solutions to simple problems like this one which must happen at least once each day at every Nando’s restaurant across the UK that offers a delivery serviceSince I have started writing this I have had a Nando’s call back and also express their disgust at how we were treated by JustEat and gave a full refund and promise of free meals in the future, although this is a fantastic gesture it was too much too late, all we wanted was our simple burger.We have ordered twice this week (£70 spend) and on both occasions have had issues with the system and will never use it again and I am also giving JustEat a swerve from now on, that’s what happens when you hang up on me mofo’s!This is the first review I have ever written and usually I just walk with my feet and never use the company again but felt compelled to share my experience",2019-08-26 18:22,{1: 'Bad'}

But how we judge service companies is not just about when things go right, but perhaps more importantly about when things go wrong.  How responsive, engaging, polite, flexible and willing to help are they?  Just Eat Customer Service fail abysmally on all of these points.  They are interested in one thing only: making money, and dam anyone who may have a problem.  We will now never use this company again as a matter of principle now that the company has revealed its true colours.What happened?  First things first.  This is a review about Just Eat - not the associated restaurants in Southend.  Secondly; we have used Just Eat a number of times.  Thirdly, we'd used Just Eat to order from same restaurant not two weeks previously with no issues.  Scene: Sunday, hungry, ordered dinner at 18:30.  First delivery time given: 19:24.  At 19:40 it was updated to 19:46.  At this point we'd been waiting for over an hour and were pretty hungry.  Had  missed calls from driver at 19:50, 19:52 and 19:55, and she called back at 20:10.  Driver told my partner that he couldn't find address, told her we 'weren't on the map' (quote), and when she asked him where he was, he said he didn't know!  She asked him if he knew area; he said he didn't need to as he had a map.  it was very difficult to understand the gentleman as English was clearly not his first language - this in itself is not a problem as we've had to give directions to a few drivers in the past with limited English.  But when she said she couldn't understand him, he hung up.She called Just Eat at 20:14, and that is when the real issues began.  She explained to customers services what had happened, including that the driver had hung up, and asked when we could expect our meal.  CS rep tried to look on map to see where driver was in relation to us, but she (apparently) couldn't see where the driver was.  CS rep then started talking about sending driver back to us, so my partner asked when he'd picked food up: was told he had collected it from restaurant at 19:32, so she pointed out that food would be cold by now.  CS rep response was apathetic and vague at best.  My partner asked if someone else could collect a new order and deliver it, only to be told that Just Eat would have cancel order and we'd have to reorder from scratch.   Having to go through loop again would mean we wouldn't eat until probably 21:30 at earliest.  CS Rep then tried to say that our address did not exist on the map ( a blatant lie as she'd already confirmed that she COULD see us on map), and tried to offer us an insulting fifty per cent refund, which, funnily enough, she declined and demanded a full refund.  Bear in mind that no Just Eat driver has ever failed to deliver to us before.CS rep then agreed to full refund, plus a £5 credit (?), and asked if she wanted to speak to supervisor.  When my partner asked to do so, she was told that there was no supervisor present!!!!  When my partner asked when she would get her refund CS rep told her 3-7 working days because restaurant had accepted the order.  Given that the transaction is with Just Eat, this is a complete nonsense and they should be able to action refund immediately - at worst case within 24 hours.  When challenged CS rep said she would 'put request through' to get refund earlier.  This is supposed to be a service company.It is worth mentioning that someone who we assume was a supervisor called us at 22:47 (!), failed to introduce himself, and asked if our food had been delivered!!  My partner replied that order had been cancelled, and before she could say anything else he said 'Ordered cancelled, ok, thanks, bye', and hung up.  What was point of call?  If this was a supervisor then perhaps he should of been calling to actually deal with complaint?  Apparently not.",2019-05-27 15:41,{1: 'Bad'}

I was told to “hold on” ... then she came back on the phone and told me it was done.Since then I’m still receiving constant advertising emails.... so came to find out it’s not closed..... on the live chat... spent 5/10 mins explaining to someone what’s going on... they just leave the chat ... and your not notified... only way you know is when you type something ( like are you still there) ... and then some new person joins the chat... so you have to start all over again...and you do this 3-4 times Then you spend 20 mins explaining ... to be told that your account has been requested to close but it takes 30 days when you have spent ages now explaining you want it closed ASAP...your waiting now for a response to this... what happens... yes the person leaves chat without notice...

I think they are keen to get as many restaurants/cafés on their site in order to maximise their profits/commissions, but they are not providing any real customer care for the end user i.e. the people who wish to order food.  For example, if something is wrong with the order they are not really interested, you are told to go to place where food has come from, but they then tell you to contact Just Eat to administer a refund.  It takes ages to get through to Just Eat, they do not seem interested.  I complained about a previous order (one item didn't turn up even though I had paid).  I asked for a refund to my bank account but they put the credit onto my just eat account.  I thought I would place another order and then the order was running late and then cancelled.  I asked Just Eat for a refund but got referred to by a different name and contact details were for someone else. I think they are very disorganised and not truly interested in the customer.

I ordered food that was three hours late (expected at 8.30 and arrived at 11.30 - obviously forgotten, as I'd had to chase the restaurant several times - by which time my partner had ordered something else and gone to bed). Deliveroo's own statement to restaurants is that customers can get a refund for delayed food. The next day I spoke to no fewer than three agents on their ridiculous live chat (that ends automatically if you move tabs or to a different app). One of them ended the chat suddenly, obviously bored with my problem (and after asking me what I'd had for dinner instead of the meal I'd ordered), the next offered me £5 credit instead of a refund on the food we'd not been able to eat, and the last just had no clue, kept telling me it was the restaurant who had to refund me (thereby removing Deliveroo from any position of responsibility for the restaurants they choose to host - very handy eh!). Finally I sent an email of complaint via email, simply wanting a sufficient response. No reply. I emailed again to say I was going to deactivate my account as I hadn't heard from them (I use Deliveroo a few times a month) and I received a generic email in response ""We are sorry about your experience etc etc, we take all feedback into consideration to improve our service blah blah."" Clearly a robot, or copied and pasted response. Deliveroo works in cynical ways and I will not be using it again. It is impossible to resolve issues, as you are chasing your tail - nothing is their fault, yet restaurants cannot act without Deliveroo's involvement. It would have been easier to get a refund on a well-used pair of running shoes. Above all, their idea of customer service and satisfaction is so incredibly unacceptable that I wonder how they are still operating. It makes me sad.

At 7:40pm the tracking app showed a driver on his way saying, due to arrive 7:50pm. At 7:50pm I got a message from the driver “ can you help me, I don’t know where you are” I message him back, asking his position but got no reply, by this time it was 7:55 but I could see his position on a route map on the app, which was the other side of the city, nowhere near my home or the restaurant!!! I went out side to wait for him and I continued to watch the tracking as he closed in on my home. The app was rescheduling the ETA as I watch his progress, now giving 8:00pm for the delivery. I then got a message at 8:00pm from the driver saying “ I am sorry but they gave me your job but did not tell me the restaurant address?? The driver eventually arrived at 8:10pm but sat in his vehicle for about 10 minutes before I came back outside to see what he was doing. He then got out of the car to say he had no food. I was furious to say he least. He asked me for the post code of the restaurant and said he would fetch my food for me, I promptly told him to leave it and went into my house. It then took me several attempts on the live chat app to get a refund. It kept saying I could not cancel because my food was being prepared?? I kept repeating I did not want food now because my evening had been spoiled. The agent who had been corresponding with me from 8:15pm eventually said to hold on while she consulted with the senior team member. I decided to go out to the shops to get a ready meal at 8:25 and she had still not got back to me. As soon as I got to the shop 8:30pm I got a call from another driver outside my home, saying “I’ve got your food, where are you” (poor sole) I told him where to put it! as I was so upset and I disconnected the call. I made my way back home from the shop at 8:44pm and just got a message from the agent saying she had arranged a refund. I arrived home and by the time I cooked and ate my food, it was 9:30pm.

This was by the Heinekenplein, I moved over to the central lane to make space for the ambulance men and injured person. Directly behind me comes a speeding  Deliveroo cyclist, ringing his bell at the ambulance, oblivious to the situation ahead or demanding his right of way, realizing there was no longer space to maneuver, he then swerved to miss the injured person, Cut me up on the inside causing me to run my wheels into the tram track and crash my bike, causing injuring my leg and damaging my bike. I shouted after him but he was off in a hurry. Luckily the ambulance men came to my assistance too. 2) You go by the McDonalds in the Pijp and all the Delivery guys hang out there. Often you see them bunched together smoking and socializing, hugging and greeting each other without a care for social distancing and apparently completely oblivious to the fact we are in the middle of a pandemic. Looks like I’ll be getting a healthy dose of Corvid-19 with my delivery order. 3) Your standing in the bike lane at the traffic lights making  space and keeping a safe distance from other riders, then these delivery guys come sailing through, forcing there way to the front hoping to get the chance to jump the lights ahead of everyone else, taking up the distancing space and breathing over the cyclist next to them, again oblivious to the fact everyone else is doing their best to protect their Health and lives.  I am not usually one for complaining but I have just had enough of these delivery cyclist making up their own rules when others are trying so hard to stay safe. I understand these guys are making their money by getting from A to Z as fast as possible, but at what cost to their own and everyone else’s health.  I wish Deliveroo and Uber Eats would do more to control and educate these guys on the health risks to others, maybe these cyclist need to pass a test before being able to deliver and maybe there should be hefty fines for reckless behavior.

I then tried calling in the customer support and a girl said that she could do it, however she mentioned having a bad internet connection and the call cut off. I called once again and another customer service representative told me that there was no way of getting my food, that it would be delivered somewhere else and I wouldn't be able to get a refund.

I'd also like the managers to check the chat logs of these customer service advisors as they said they were going to speak to managers but they obviously never did, this is also listed on the chat log, luckily this time I have screenshot both the conversations I had which I can't post here but I will do on Facebook and Twitter,Your advisors need to understand some people are in difficult financial situations and have children to feed I tried to take the offer from co-op for the super saver deal all I've ended up with was half the order and 4 well 5 including me hungry people and extremely rude customer service advisors, Please just remember if you speak to customer services on the chat service with deliveroo heaven help you if you deal with Robin or DJ, I'd rather go back in the queue because these two won't help, it was obvious they were just playing immature games and not trying to help,£5 is a lot of money to us, £5 to deliveroo due to their mistakes not my mistakes is nothing I am owed this money because I was promised it and the chat logs will prove it",2020-08-24 17:18,{1: 'Bad'}

Out of the four times I have ordered items, I’ve only received that correct order and no hassle on one occasion.  On the first occasion I ordered a pizza plus a few other items. The pizza was just cheese and tomato however a pepperoni one was delivered.  I didn’t realise this until after the driver had left.  As I do not eat pepperoni, I went to bed without any dinner (toddler was already asleep and I’m a single parent). I reported through the Deliveroo site that I had received the incorrect item and the response was that they would let their partner know.  Nothing about receiving a refund. Tonight, I order a bundle deal and the driver turned up and took my photo (without permission) as I opened the door.  He then asked for me to confirm my name and address and date of birth.  I asked why and he said that I had ordered alcohol.  I had ordered Diet Coke not alcohol so showed him the order that was in the bag.  At this point I realised that the ice cream part of the bundle was missing but the driver refused to do anything unless I gave him my DOB.  I refused again and he said he couldn’t leave without my DOB.  In the end I told him I wouldn’t except the order with an item missing and was not giving him my DOB.

I find placing an order with Deliveroo, whether using the app or their website, to be very user friendly. Depending whether you want a meal or shopping there are lots of choices from restaurants and takeaway establishments to shops and a larger supermarket. Pricing is fair and affordable. The delivery drivers who I have dealt with have all been polite and professional. Delivery usually takes between 30 minutes to an hour. But in My experience the order is usually between 25 to 45 minutes. My latest order took 30 minutes and was placed on my door step with the delivery driver waiting at the gate to make sure I received the order. I started using Deliveroo in April. Due to underlying health conditions I'm in the highly vulnerable group for COVID-19 and have been in shielding since the end of March. Deliveroo has been a God send when I can't get an online delivery for shopping. Or I want some treats or a takeaway but don't want to trouble my friend, who has been helping get my shopping if I can't get a delivery slot, when I only need some essentials and/or treats.

About 4 days my account was hacked and somebody spent £220 on chinese using my card details. I actually thought atleast somebody was fed from my expense, I received a full refund from my bank account so was happy! I placed my next order tonight for 3 items, 2 for me and 1 for my girlfriend. When receiving our order and looking through the bag, my girlfriend noticed her item was missing! We called the restaurant directly to ask about this, and they confirmed the 3 items were definitely given to the Deliveroo delivery driver. They even sent CCTV footage of this to us! They also mentioned they had received feedback previously stating they had complaints about this same delivery driver. I then called Deliveroo who to be fair to them instantly gave me credit for the item we had not received. As soon as I went to replace the order using the credit I noticed that we had to repay the delivery charge. When I spoke to Deliveroo again they said there was nothing they could do. So there’s me sitting eating my food, whilst my girlfriend sits with no food (she can’t eat mine as she’s vegan) and as all guys know an unhappy girlfriend is an unhappy boyfriend!

Everything was as it should be for the most part.However on this last delivery, the app offered and accepted an order when the restaurant was closed.Again to be fair the driver/cyclist had the courtesy to call me to inform me first. Shortly after the order was listed as ""Delivered"". Which frankly was a second error. Then after I contacted them by email, customer service rang from an international phone number at 1.15am to ask me in broken english if I wanted a ""refund or Deliveroo credit for the same amount?"" Accepting the refund, I was told I should receive it in several days time. No verdict there yet.Then the call ended with customer service telling me to ""have a nice day"" at 1.30am.So someone in a call centre at the other side of the planet(in daylight) has my phone number now as well.The 3 stars are for previous services rendered and the simple courtesy shown by the driver/cyclist.The sudden rise of this company looks as though it will be mirrored by a sudden fall in the near future at present.I can only wish them luck.",2020-08-01 03:36,{3: 'Average'}

This is of course a failure to protect customer data, and complete apathy to a customer's concern about their data, so if I receive any more unwanted calls I will be lodging a complaint with the information commissioner's office.I am stunned at how terrible their customer support is, and they have no formal complaints procedure, presumably because it would be immediately overwhelmed with angry customers.

The live chat service is disgusting they never want to give you refund its hard to even get credit even when your order has been out for delivery for an Hour since pickup they won't ask the kitchen you ordered on to send more.

I asked Deliveroo for some compensation towards a reorder if was to be forced into placing another order and waiting another 40 mins but they flatly refused. As I had guests I felt I couldn’t push this so reluctantly accepted a refund and re ordered. I called the restaurant again to let them know this and to ask for a quick delivery. They told me the food could be ready in 10 mins but that Deliveroo would not expedite a rider so we were forced to wait a further 40 mins. Bottom line is that the restaraunt seemed to be trying hard to make good whereas Deliveroo behaved like a big corporate with a “computer says no attitude” pretty poor service in my view and I will think twice about using them in the future.",2020-07-19 12:23,{1: 'Bad'}

I was told by my delivery agent that there was no need to worry, it had just been picked up and was on the way. 30+ minutes later I get a call (whilst on the phone complaining) that the delivery is delayed.Well I could have guessed that at this point. The order was then, without my asking, cancelled. I asked for a full refund and was told that the money wasn't taking so all was good.

No matter how many times I explained I only ordered the second meal as the first was cancelled by them, I now had to pay and receive another order I didn't want in the first God damn place.

I rang the restaurant who admitted that there werent enough drivers to accomodate the demand of the service that evening. I contacted deliveroo and they offered 13.95 credit. I responded saying it was an outrage and I should be at least receiving a full refund. After that all they said was basically theyve taken my complaint on board. Awful....,2020-07-04 16:49,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,5ef636e67dd75306b8ce8c4f,5c057c635483f4b8a9bef83f,Consistently useless.,"Deliveroo is one of these companies where the concept is great but the customer service is absolutely useless!! I made a complaint and it took a week for someone to come back to me, and this was only through me sending a further two follow ups. They delivered the wrong order, which had been sealed incorrectly and spilt all over our carpet and doormat when we took it out of the drivers bag. We then spent a Friday night cleaning up somebody else’s order - which is obviously exactly how I wanted to spend my Friday night!! The driver Louis was actually really helpful throughout and was a credit to the company. The call I got from deliveroo to ask the seemingly pointless question of if I still wanted my food and to apologise was as useless as always. I then wrote a customer complaint to which their clearly automated response was that they have taken my feedback onboard and will make improvements but cannot provide any compensation on this occasion. A great idea but poor execution. The food is usually great but that isn’t down to deliveroo, some serious improvement needed on their side.",2020-06-26 17:56,{1: 'Bad'}

It is about 25 minutes from my house. It accepted my order and then after they hacked my payment I got a notice shortly after that Maxime my driver was making another delivery on the way.  My food was on the road for over 40 minutes after having been picked up and arrived lukewarm. The first delivery was all the way in Kanata and then he doubled back to make my delivery. I reached out to Uber and they are experts in passive bullying saying they gave a 4.99 refund on an almost $40 order and as far as they were concerned they were happy. They also tried to blame the restaurant for not packing it well. If dumplings are going to go on a grand tour of Ottawa before getting to the customer there is no way they could pack it any better. They have a very slick team with slick answers being sympathetic and thanking me for their input but not taking ownership. Why do they not give the customer a choice if we want our food not running around in a car to other destinations. That is bad business. And obviously reading all of the reviews now this is a common practice. They exploit the restaurant, they exploit the drivers and they rip off the customer by not taking the care of the meal that the restaurant worked so hard to make. I will never use them again and I will just get in my car an order no matter where and it will still arrive hot because I go right home. The BS that they write including ""no need to reply to this e mail"" comment is arrogant and shows what a horrible corporate culture they have. Shame on them for wiping the floor with all of us.

UberEats,60759b79f85d75087059b9bf,60759b559d423f0019bc967a,Waste,"Absolutely horrible customer service and honestly ripping off customer left right and center.I’ll give you a few examples.A while ago, I ordered food from a restaurant that had their own drivers, fair enough that they can’t track the drivers on the app, but my order was supposed to arrive at 2am, and I was still waiting until 4 o’clock to atleast get a response?? Which I didn’t even get. When you go on the app and press the “my order hasn’t arrived yet” button, it litterally says “not long now, your order has left the restaurant”, even if you press the button 50 times over 2 hours. The other option is to call the restaurant, and of course they don’t pick up the phone, because the restaurant closed not long after “your order left the restaurant”. There isn’t even an option to say this ordered didn’t arrive? Just imagine that, coming home from work and you’re starving and this is the waste of time you have to deal with when you could’ve eat and been fast asleep if you ordered from deliveroo. Now another example, This time I ordered a McDonalds, which is about 5 minutes away from my house, I paid a £3.99 delivery fee which shouldn’t even cost a pound, but that’s fine, only for the food to arrive missing one of the main meals. So I went on the app and clicked on the missing items in my order, and instead of giving me a choice of still receiving half my order which I obviously wanted, I just got “you’ve been refunded for this meal” with no options to speak to the customer service team or atleast leave a message. So I had to go and order the meal again and pay an extra £3.99 again for the delivery. Then I thought let me just send them a message on the help section to refund me the £3.99 for the second delivery because obviously it wasn’t my fault that they forgot the order. I litterally turned the whole app inside out and there is no option to speak to the customer service team. The only thing I was able to type a message on, was the “food damage or quality issue”. And guess what the reply was.. an automated reply, saying “you’ve already been refunded for this order, as such we trust this issue has been successfully resolved and will be closing this thread”. Like? What do you mean successfully resolved?? No one even read what I just said. I didn’t ask about the refund? Honestly I don’t even know how to put it down politely.. They need to shut this whole app, website, business down all together because who are they serving? I looked at the rest of the reviews and everyone is just as disappointed! Don’t even get me started on the Uber App for taxi’s, I got dropped off 20 minutes away from the destination i put on the app because the driver decided to “avoid the traffic” in the route i take twice a day to work and turned 2 minutes into 20. I had to walk the same distance that I would’ve if I walked from my house and get there half an hour late. And still paid £8 that they weren’t even willing to give me a refund for after messaging for a whole day to the same automated reply system. Absolute joke.",2021-04-13 13:24,{1: 'Bad'}

The most they offered to fix a $40 dinner that was almost completely wrong was a $5 credit next time.  They didn't seem to understand that I at least wanted the messed up dishes credited.  I literally contacted them over a dozen times over weeks on their help center area, a separate e-mail, and even social media.  Kept getting the same dumb responses like no one was paying attention.  In the end I had to do a chargeback to get credited that back, which I really didn't want to do and warned them I would resort to that if I didn't get a non-copy-and-paste response back not even reading my complaint.Then after the bank sided with me on it (sounds like they have lots of issues like this), UberEats tried to block me from using the app unless I paid the full amount.

On Sunday 14th March, I ordered some food via their app from Kick Ass Burrito in Great Park, Birmingham. The food, although ordered by me, was actually bought by my 11 year old son for a Mother's day treat.After waiting a few minutes past the estimated time of arrival, I checked the app and was alarmed to see that my order had in fact been cancelled, with no refund, as (allegedly) the driver had been trying to contact me for 7 minutes. This is absolutely not true and, quite frankly, a blatant lie! From where we were sat, we can see every single person approaching our house and at NO point did we see anyone go past our house, let alone attempt to knock our door. Furthermore, I had my phone in my hand throughout the whole time and at no point did anyone try to call me. Perhaps they were struggling to locate my property? I have no idea. However, I do know that absolutely NO attempt was made to contact by any means, ie. The phone, my door, the email or via the app.Every response I have received via the app just comes back with the same content, repeating that the driver tried to contact me for 7 minutes. This is not true at all. Their responses don't acknowledge a thing I have said, just an awful automated response. This now means that £8.55 of MY money has gone straight down the drain. This is absolutely not acceptable!I want my money or, rather, my 11 year old son's money back immediately. I have tried every means to contact their team, but to no avail.

The most upsetting response was feeling like i was accused of not checking my phone and being told i should do that in future when they clearly did not address my explanation of being in touch with the driver. I have since sent across screenshot of my call log history to provide proof that I have been wrong accused.Errors can happen and I'm not sure if it was the restaurant who marked it wrong or if there was an issue with the delivery driver. I will not blame either because in this instance I'm simply disappointed with UberEats customer support approach. I will make sure I escalate until they address the response appropriately.  It is also worth to note for UberEats to recognise that automated responses are great but they need to ensure that they don't miss out on their customer's queries and address them correctly without telling the customer off without an accurate investigation.Anyways, from a stats perspective  I've probably order over 30 times and it had all been good. I suppose the issue here is with their customer support.",2021-04-11 09:35,{1: 'Bad'}

My food from Brown Eagle Caribbean shop was 4 tablespoons of rice, bones and fat. I complained to the restaurant and UberEats. I was told by UberEats ‘sorry we can’t do anything because you never complained within 48hrs. Another order Capital house kebab shop. I received a quarter of the container of rice for £13, service charges and £2.79 delivery charge. I had to cook my own food after.  I complained within an hour and was told oh you need to rate the company and one day someone will look at the ratings for the restaurant. Right forget about ratings for the restaurant, I’m complaining about my order. Another order, I waited 30mins and received a message 5mins before arrival to say ‘your order has been cancelled’ no explanation as to why. I received a support message to say it was cancelled and thanks for my understanding. Unreal, Uber stick to only rides and even that you can’t do right.

I was quite pleased with the Uber Eats Pass, and was planning to auto subscribe after this month of a trial that I gave it.But then a couple of days ago I ordered KFC and then, immediately after placing the order, got a notification from my bank that I was about to be overdrawn. I needed that twenty or so dollars in my account to cover an automatic bill payment.The order had literally been confirmed by the restaurant for three or four seconds when I canceled. But apparently if you cancel after the restaurant has accepted, you don't get a refund because supposedly the restaurant has already begun to prepare your meal. I highly doubt that they were already preparing my meal only three seconds after it had been accepted, but I was not going to receive a refund? $18 for food that they had not even begun to prepare.I sent several emails and, while they took their time, not replying until the next day while in the meantime, the bill payment was unsuccessful from my account, causing me to be given an overdraft charge from my bank.When I finally did receive the email the next day, I was told that because I apparently didn't know about the cancellation policy they would refund my money this one time.What kind of a policy is that? If you cancel an order, there should not be an issue with getting a refund. I have never heard of such a ridiculous policy.Uber Eats wants you to pay extra for a Pass which really doesn't save you any money when you consider their fees, the jacked-up prices, and tips, and even if you are a regular customer ordering at least several times a week, you're not entitled to a refund the one time you cancel?A complete rip-off.

UberEats,6071bb66f85d750870545019,6071bb5f4e58c70019f8797f,A Once Great Company Gone Bad,"I’ve spent thousands of dollars and have been a customer for over five years (like most of you I’m sure)... the customer service, rewards program, Uber Pass (including eats), and overall  quality of service has declined; ironic because the cost continues to increase beyond taxes, delivery fees, and Restaurant menu prices (the food cost more $$ on UBER EATS than in-store). With higher cost, customers expect prime delivery service and Better customer service. The Uber rides pass is probably the only “good” thing the company has going which is why I rated this 2 stars instead of 1. The pass actually protects you from “surcharges” during “high demand hours”, plus route protection for your favorite route. Cool. The Uber Eats pass is a joke considering that it charges you to “save” but only if YOU spend over $15 on food. And if you don’t, then you’re charged “A Small Order Fee” (no lunch orders for you). Plus, the more you order, the higher your “service charge “ which is higher than the “delivery fee” and taxes . Last, The Uber rewards program is the biggest rip off I’ve ever seen because it’s supposed to “reward customers “ for being ripped off for the “passes” ($35.99 monthly) while providing you customer service based on  Uber’s tier levels. In order from lowest to highest: Blue (0), Gold (500pt), Platinum (2500 pt), and Diamond (7500 pt) . Pretty much the points are equivalence to dollars. Sounds fine except every year, Uber makes it impossible for the customer to achieve the highest level unless you’re spending thousands (literally) within months (literally) or your tier level expires and bump you down to BLUE. Where you have to restart as if you’re in a real-life Super Mario Game. I’ve managed to reach the Platinum level only to hold it for 3 months and lose it because each tier restarts in 6 months. #Bummer PS. Uber cash in system with the “points” suck because they still require you to spend hella money for a discount that you’ve been deserved since depending on Daddy Uber in the first place.

You simply can't get in touch or complain to them, so your out of pocket and no meal.I have however complained to McDonald's after all they deal with these fools. I'll never use them again driver could hardly speak English which didn't help.",2021-04-09 22:18,{1: 'Bad'}

Quickest way to lose your money. Next time just use Deliveroo or Just Eat because at least they try to resolve the issue.",2021-04-09 20:16,{1: 'Bad'}

UberEats,6070a967f85d750870531246,5cb0cb42b158a877ff45531a,I ordered a coffee and cake from Uber…,"I ordered a coffee and cake from Uber Eats. Around the delivery time I was unable to answer my phone ringing as I have a young baby who was upset. No one knocked on my door or triggered my Ring doorbell. When I next checked my phone my order was cancelled, emails said the driver waited 7 minutes and because I didn’t reply he drove off. And I would be charged - no refund to be issued. I complained several times to be told it was my fault. I explained my doorbell hadn’t captured anyone all evening and my calls from the driver were 3 minutes apart not 7...Shocking. No goods but charged, customer service not willing to even consider my argument. Case closed apparently. Will never use again.",2021-04-09 19:22,{1: 'Bad'}
