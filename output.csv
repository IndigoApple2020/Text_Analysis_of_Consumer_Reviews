Second time I've given you guys a go after an awful experience first time (Nandos, nightmare with drivers arriving three times and numerous calls to Nandos and Deliveroo with nobody having a clue what the other is doing, or the drivers!) Ordered food from Aldi, 2 items didnt arrive, yet when I queried it I was told my request was not accepted and no refund for the items I didnt even receive would be made! How can that be acceptable?? I email to state I was very unhappy and that was ignored and the full amount debited from my account. I then spoke to someone on twitter who got back to me, but then on supplying more info nobody has got back since... absolutely shocking service and if I can help it I'd not use your service again if there's other options I can take.",2021-04-07 15:52,{1: 'Bad'}

606cd01df85d7508704c27da,606ccfe826bd26001b4410a6,"Scam! Charged multiple times for missing items, refused a refund","SCAM - I am surprised they are still allowed to operate! Customer service is terribly poor (at least in Edinburgh, Scotland, though since it's an international company, it's probably the same everywhere). A restaurant (Subway) failed to deliver some items and also delivered wrong items - I was refused a refund, basically paying for food that never arrived. Talking to Deliveroo ""live agents"" feels like talking to a rude chatbot - it looks like they have a system where they will refund you once or twice but will stop refunding after that as if it were the customer's fault that he or she receives an incomplete or wrong order more than twice. I order quite frequently and am a paying ""Deliveroo plus"" subscriber (though after recent experiences I will not be renewing my subscription).The script with ""live agents"" (although ""zombie agents"" would be a more accurate description) usually goes like this:1) I'm sorry to hear that - let me look into it for you.2) Thanks for waiting. I'm sorry for the problems you've had with your order, we will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. We're unable to offer you a refund in this instance.When challenged why they charge for wrong items or items that never arrived, they respond with:1) We review each claim on a case by case basis and have taken all the information you have provided into consideration. Based on the information available, we're unable to offer you a refund.2) I'm sorry that you are unhappy with the resolution, if you would like to discuss this further, please send us an email to [Deliveroo's email address]They claim to contact you by email within 24-48 hours but at least on two separate occasions failed to do so.I strongly encourage other people in the same situation to take LEGAL ACTION against Deliveroo using SMALL CLAIMS COURT or similar courts in your jurisdiction. Being forced to pay for food that never arrived is stealing and would never happen in an actual restaurant - they really are milking it during the lockdown/pandemic when very few alternatives are available and most people can't be bothered spending so much time chasing a huge unresponsive company that steals from people while many are struggling financially due to the pandemic.UNETHICAL AND RUDE!",2021-04-06 21:18,{1: 'Bad'}

606ca044f85d7508704bc773,5d89d54c7c6eb177e6857c7b,If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have had previous bad experiences with Deliveroo where they didn't assign drivers for my delivery leading to me waiting for an hour before I call them and I am informed about there being no driver to deliver my food so I have to cancel my order and request a refund, which is only a credit to my Deliveroo account and not a credit to my bank account. Because of this I haven't really been using them. But 2 weeks ago I wanted a pizza so ordered on at 7.20. I had an ETA of 8.05. At 8.15 I called the restaurant and the line was engaged. This went on until 9.00. I had intended on sharing this pizza, with my daughter, but ended up having to make her something. I called Deliveroo at 9.15 and asked to speak to a supervisor when a refund wasn't granted. The supervisor refused and said they had to investigate which would take 72 hours. So at 9.45 I have to bundle my sleeping daughter in the car and go to the McDonald's drive through. While I am there I receive a call and when I ask if it's the pizza delivery guy he hangs up. When we get home at almost 10.00 there's a stone cold pizza outside my door. Deliveroo and all these other fast food delivery services are a joke. In the end my bank did a charge back(which I hope all of the many disgruntled customers are using, because when they refuse you a refund they're hoping we'll just swallow it, but most banks will support you). I think I'm a big softy at heart because after my previous experiences with Deliveroo I kept my account, but on this occasion enough is enough and they've been cancelled. Deliveroo are a massive con, because they charge an average of £5.00 a delivery plus card fee(unless you are a direct debit customer, which is what they are trying to push all of their customers towards), and many of their drivers don't know where they are going even after I have put instructions on how to find me. I have lost count of the amount of times I have been asked to come and collect my food (which I always refuse because the delivery is paid for). Also their customer service isn't very good, as they are based overseas and don't know anything about the local area or how close things are. As when a driver hasn't arrived after 2 hours and the restaurant is less than 2 miles away you would think that they would understand how bad the level of service is, but they don't. MY ADVICE TO ANYONE READING THIS IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND WHEN YOU SEE GET DELIVERY FOR FREE, AVOID AVOID AVOID. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO STRIPE YOU UP TO BECOME A CUSTOMER PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. I WISH WE COULD GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE RESTAURANTS HAD THEIR OWN DRIVERS INSTEAD OF USIBG THESE SERVICES, AS IT'S THE FOOD WE WANT. NOT THE MIDDLEMAN. ONCE LOCKDOWN IS OVER I WILL BE CANCELLING MY JUST EAT ACCOUNT TOO, AS THEY'RE JUST AS BAD, THEY'RE ONLY BETTER THAN DELIVEROO BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER.",2021-04-06 17:54,{1: 'Bad'}

After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting (which I sat by the window 10 minutes prior to delivery time so I could watch for them) I  contacted deliveroo through their live chat and was told that she had spoken to the Gold Moon and the food would be with me in 5 mins. So 5 mins later I phoned Gold Moon myself. It seems they travel in a tardis to make their deliveries. I was told by a very rude and unhelpful man that the driver had in that 5 mins drove to my address, tried to contact me, then drove back to the restaurant and explained what had happened before I rang. Quite a miracle as its a 15 min round trip.I contacted deliveroo by email and attached screenshots of all communication and call logs which quite clearly prove the driver could never have been here. The next day I called deliveroo who were about as useful as a chocolate tea pot. The woman I spoke to had no interest in trying to help and just kept banging on about having to speak to the restaurant as they did their own deliveries. They needed to ask whether the food had been delivered according to them. Well of course they're going to say it has you dozy mare! And surprise surprise I received an email saying the restaurant had confirmed they had tried and therefore I wasn't entitled to a refund.Turns out the place has a reputation for taking payments and not delivering the I've since found out when I googled them. There are many reviews saying the same thing. In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the rating before I ordered. Then again you wouldn't expect a company as big as deliveroo to allow scamming, thieving businesses to trade through them.Anyway I contacted my bank and disputed the payment and got my money back.

This is below their costs, and means they’re actually loosing money to work with Deliveroo, who have so far refused to deal with them and even suspended their account for complaining. Looking on the internet there are various articles showing this is not an isolated case by some rogue employees or a coding error, but their actual business model during the pandemic. Whilst they know that many restaurants have no other route to market and are desperate, they’re just charging very high commission rates, knowing full well these companies are on their knees and unable to fight back. Without these partner companies, Deliveroo is nothing but this is how they treat them during a national crisis. And it gets worse, they also regularly see which restaurants are most successful in a given area and copy their menu with minor tweaks operating out of industrial units with their own ""exclusive brands"", so they can steal their market share as well as charge high levels of commission. Clearly this is to try and bolster profits prior to their up-coming IPO, but at what cost, effectively extorting small businesses who cannot fight back, absolutely disgusting and predatory. And reading other reviews here, I guess unsurprisingly they treat the riders poorly too.I've cancelled my premium account today and deleted the app and shown this to everyone I know, this kind of abusive way of running businesses makes me sick and I want no part of it.

She then told me that she would refund me £5.99 so I could re-order it, however I let her know £5.99 would cover the food but not delivery and service which I had already paid for initially when I ordered the food, so I wouldn’t be able to get it delivered for that price.After 5 minutes of arguing with me, she said she’ll speak to someone and put me on hold again for a few minutes, and then told me she could refund the delivery fee but not the service fee, I told her this is still unacceptable since I still would not be able to get the food delivered for that price.I then asked her why she couldn’t call the delivery driver and ask him if he could deliver the food if he still had it and she told me that it’s been 20 minutes now and the food would be bad quality. Which was terrible because the food that was sitting on the table had been there for 20 minutes while I was on the phone with her. If she had come up with that resolution in the first place when I had called her, it would have been good quality food and arrived a minute later than expected.The reason I got so annoyed in the first place is that I  only ordered from Pizza Hut for the nachos, the rest of it I didn’t care about that much. I would’ve ordered elsewhere if I knew I wouldn’t get the nachos.Overall very dissatisfied with the service, not only did I not get the nachos, I didn’t get the bare minimum refund so I could re-order them.

They didn‘t look left nor right and kept on cycling wherever they want. I get the drivers want to be as fast as possible and are under time pressure, but it‘s a huge safety hazard because the cyclist usually come out of the middle of nowhere, they are quick and usually don‘t even see or watch out for pedestrians. For the service: ordered twice, the drivers were always friendly and thankful about tips. Once though we waited for four hours because the delivery vehicle broke down and they had to place a new order. That was a bummer, but the food was worth it. And to be fair, a competent Asian woman immediately called and there was transparency, but I‘d rather this did not happen. I would get a Deliveroo subscription, because they do have more restaurants than Justeat. My main concern though are the cyclists who don‘t care for human lives.

In fact, they had disconnected the minute they sent the last message. Even if they were to disconnect, they should have sent a message saying they were going to. Live customer service chats aren't innovative to Deliveroo. How come other companies, whether it'd be internet providers, phone companies, online shopping sites, have managed to use live chats successfully but not Deliveroo?Upon reaching out through email I was also ignored until now. They wasted no time in sending promotional emails during that time though. Obviously, you can tell what's important to them. And I trust that the delay is not because they haven't had time to reply but because they straight up don't care what concerns I'm having.Anyway, 9 days later I never got a refund or email confirmation. So of course, I contacted their live chat again. I was told that the refund had actually been added to my account as credit but that they will redirect it to my bank account.I didn't know such poor customer service still existed nowadays as I had been using other services.This all happened during their $1 delivery promo and now I know why they needed it.Lesson: don't expect much from cheap things.",2021-03-15 08:46,{1: 'Bad'}

I have used Deliveroo a lot over lockdown, and have happily paid for their Deliveroo Plus subscription for the last six months or so.The service was generally pretty good, but occasionally things go wrong. That's fine, I understand that. They were generally pretty good at fixing things when they did - until recently.I had a series of orders go wrong: one driver claimed not to be able to find my building, and claimed he had called me, and just disappeared with £50+ of curry. Another driver delivered a £20 order to an entirely different building. ""OK, sure, whatever,"" I thought. ""Not a big issue, as when this sort of stuff happens Deliveroo are good at sorting it out.""How wrong can you be? Both times, Deliveroo refused to refund me for these, claiming their T&Cs meant *I* was at fault. After much back and forth I finally got the refunds. That was the point that the warning signs began to appear. Problem is, it's convenient. ""I'll give them another chance,"" I thought. BAD IDEA. Things have gone from bad to worse.The final straw was when I ordered some groceries from the Coop - everything came except a £3 box of blueberries. Fine, no problem. I reported it as missing in the app - previously when something similar had happened (some salmon missing) I reported it in the app and they simply corrected the amount billed to my card. Not this time: I got an email telling me that they were not going to refund me for this. No reason why. I queried this. Still no reason given. I told them that I was insisting in on a refund and would not give up.I then got an email from one of their customer service reps threatening to terminate my Deliveroo Account and implying that I'd previously made fraudulent claims. Interesting, given that *every single time* I had an issue I sent them photographs and they refunded me without quibbling, until the past few weeks. I told them that if they were going to allege I was breaching their T&Cs they should send me that evidence - and if they could not, I expected the £3 refund within 72 hours. £3 refund came through.Now, obviously I wasted WAY more than £3 of my time on this. But the thing is, why should a company promise to deliver something, bill you on that basis - and then when they don't send something they promised, claim that you should still be billed in full? That makes me really furious. First time it was £50 of curry, second time it was £20 of wine, third time it was £3 of blueberries. I can understand the £50 hit - no company wants to have lots of those. But £3 of blueberries: that's the price they put on my loyalty as a long standing, moderately high-spending customer, and clearly that's what their brand equity is worth.£3.Pathetic.I'm assuming this is them trying to tighten things up in the run up to their IPO, and the customer service team have been told to aggressively dispute everything to increase revenue. Doesn't bode well for the post-IPO status of the company if they have to use dishonest tactics like this in order to protect revenues.It'll be interesting to see what price the stock floats at - as it will surely be hugely overvalued based on this. You can be aggressive with your customers for a couple of months, but when you absolutely destroy customer trust and loyalty the business is built in shakey foundations.I've now cancelled my Deliveroo Plus membership and will move my spend elsewhere.",2021-03-08 14:14,{1: 'Bad'}

The worst part was the customer service, no care at all and couldn’t simply say ‘sorry about that, I’ll call the restaurant and request the same order for you again and send it out to you with no cost’ as you’d expect.

I signed up because they were offering a code, MARCH10 with £10 credit and free delivery for 14 days. Sounds like a great deal I thought. Created an account, ordered, everything seemed OK at checkout. The discount applied. Suddenly after I entered my payment details and clicked onto next page, message pops up 'discount code invalid' or words to that effect, and order was CONFIRMED! Immediately cancelled the order to prevent it going any further, luckily the restaurant hadn't accepted it yet!Messaged Deliveroo on their web chat, they were completely unhelpful, saying because I cancelled the order there was no way I could get reimbursed for the credit and I had lost it. Then they told me that I was not entitled to the offer in the first place, even though nobody else in my household has ever used Deliveroo before, or set up an account. The agent I spoke to referred me to a manager but they were equally as unhelpful, even more so in fact, rude at times and couldn't wait to get off the chat. I actually politely requested if we could resolve it there and then but then they just cut the chat short while I was typing.

I created an account and placed a KFC order which totalled £37 due to ridiculous service and delivery charges, so entered the code and got it down to £27 (£1 cheaper in total than if we ordered through Just Eat). When got to checkout, Honey offered to apply some voucher codes and when done, said there weren't any available but a message appeared on the website saying the code we had used for £10 off was invalid as it had already been used - standard stuff.Confirmed the order for £27 and again received another error that the code had already been used on this account and the £10 voucher had been removed. Assumed it was an error due to Honey trying the code again and went back and refreshed the checkout page. Total showed that it was still £27, figured it was just a glitches and I completed the order. Next thing I know I've been charged £37 and the order is complete. I immediately try to cancel the order but the website says I can't. I go on live chat and ask them to cancel the order and they say they can't because KFC already has my order.I ask them what to do about the extra £10 I've just been charged and they flat out refuse to help - I have a joint bank account with my wife and apparantly she's ordered using her own card before, which means my deliveroo account and hers are judged to be the same account.Tried explaining that we weren't notified of any stipulations with the order not being able to use a bank account that's been used before, and that if I was really doing this to scam a tenner I wouldn't be asking for the order to be cancelled completely, but the agent kept trying to terminate the chat after not getting a response every 30 seconds.Couldn't even reject the delivery at the door as the doorbell rang, and as soon as I got to it the driver was already in his car driving away. To cap it off, food was stone cold and had items missing. No one would willingly pay nearly £40 for a KFC for 3 people, let alone one that was freezing. Going to open a claim with the bank and won't use deliveroo again. Crap service at unreasonable prices, Just Eat isn't much better service wise but is a hell of a lot cheaper for the same food!Also, check through the other reviews, this isn't the first time they've screwed over customers with promo codes.

Causes deliveries to go to imaginary addresses which cannot be fixed once you have paid. Contacting the driver/rider was virtually impossible until he finally called me after I had contacted Deliveroo Head Office by Live Chat (Phone number system gave me for driver did not work). One hour ten minutes later, having been told that I cannot get a refund because the restaurant had produced the food, I am left with no lunches for two of us, am potentially out of pocket and the food produced (fish and chips, sausage and chips, and all the trimmings is wasted). I would starve before trying to use Deliveroo ever again.",2021-02-26 15:06,{1: 'Bad'}

Said I didn't look like I'm from the postcode he delivered to, because it's an affluent area and I'm a coloured person. Driver must be sacked immediately and restaurant investigated. The online live chat agent at Deliveroo said he phoned the restaurant while he put me on hold, and gave me feedback that he found the management to be very aggressive. The chat agent was very kind and reassuring, he promised my complaint will be esculated to the serious complaints team.  I await the outcome. This happened in Belgravia, city of Westminster London The least likely place, because it is so diverse.",2021-02-26 03:37,{1: 'Bad'}
