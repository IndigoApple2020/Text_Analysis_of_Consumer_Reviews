Wanted to get rembushed for different in cost. Been out of pocket over this last time so I didnt't want excuses but live chat staff tried to end my chat twice and was passed onto a manager who tried to end it as well with excuses. Each case is looked into and wasn't accepted for a refund. I'm £3.75 out of pocket.,2021-04-09 16:55,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606cd01df85d7508704c27da,606ccfe826bd26001b4410a6,"Scam! Charged multiple times for missing items, refused a refund","SCAM - I am surprised they are still allowed to operate! Customer service is terribly poor (at least in Edinburgh, Scotland, though since it's an international company, it's probably the same everywhere). A restaurant (Subway) failed to deliver some items and also delivered wrong items - I was refused a refund, basically paying for food that never arrived. Talking to Deliveroo ""live agents"" feels like talking to a rude chatbot - it looks like they have a system where they will refund you once or twice but will stop refunding after that as if it were the customer's fault that he or she receives an incomplete or wrong order more than twice. I order quite frequently and am a paying ""Deliveroo plus"" subscriber (though after recent experiences I will not be renewing my subscription).The script with ""live agents"" (although ""zombie agents"" would be a more accurate description) usually goes like this:1) I'm sorry to hear that - let me look into it for you.2) Thanks for waiting. I'm sorry for the problems you've had with your order, we will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. We're unable to offer you a refund in this instance.When challenged why they charge for wrong items or items that never arrived, they respond with:1) We review each claim on a case by case basis and have taken all the information you have provided into consideration. Based on the information available, we're unable to offer you a refund.2) I'm sorry that you are unhappy with the resolution, if you would like to discuss this further, please send us an email to [Deliveroo's email address]They claim to contact you by email within 24-48 hours but at least on two separate occasions failed to do so.I strongly encourage other people in the same situation to take LEGAL ACTION against Deliveroo using SMALL CLAIMS COURT or similar courts in your jurisdiction. Being forced to pay for food that never arrived is stealing and would never happen in an actual restaurant - they really are milking it during the lockdown/pandemic when very few alternatives are available and most people can't be bothered spending so much time chasing a huge unresponsive company that steals from people while many are struggling financially due to the pandemic.UNETHICAL AND RUDE!",2021-04-06 21:18,{1: 'Bad'}

Deliveroo,606ca044f85d7508704bc773,5d89d54c7c6eb177e6857c7b,If I could give 0 stars I would,"If I could give 0 stars I would. I have had previous bad experiences with Deliveroo where they didn't assign drivers for my delivery leading to me waiting for an hour before I call them and I am informed about there being no driver to deliver my food so I have to cancel my order and request a refund, which is only a credit to my Deliveroo account and not a credit to my bank account. Because of this I haven't really been using them. But 2 weeks ago I wanted a pizza so ordered on at 7.20. I had an ETA of 8.05. At 8.15 I called the restaurant and the line was engaged. This went on until 9.00. I had intended on sharing this pizza, with my daughter, but ended up having to make her something. I called Deliveroo at 9.15 and asked to speak to a supervisor when a refund wasn't granted. The supervisor refused and said they had to investigate which would take 72 hours. So at 9.45 I have to bundle my sleeping daughter in the car and go to the McDonald's drive through. While I am there I receive a call and when I ask if it's the pizza delivery guy he hangs up. When we get home at almost 10.00 there's a stone cold pizza outside my door. Deliveroo and all these other fast food delivery services are a joke. In the end my bank did a charge back(which I hope all of the many disgruntled customers are using, because when they refuse you a refund they're hoping we'll just swallow it, but most banks will support you). I think I'm a big softy at heart because after my previous experiences with Deliveroo I kept my account, but on this occasion enough is enough and they've been cancelled. Deliveroo are a massive con, because they charge an average of £5.00 a delivery plus card fee(unless you are a direct debit customer, which is what they are trying to push all of their customers towards), and many of their drivers don't know where they are going even after I have put instructions on how to find me. I have lost count of the amount of times I have been asked to come and collect my food (which I always refuse because the delivery is paid for). Also their customer service isn't very good, as they are based overseas and don't know anything about the local area or how close things are. As when a driver hasn't arrived after 2 hours and the restaurant is less than 2 miles away you would think that they would understand how bad the level of service is, but they don't. MY ADVICE TO ANYONE READING THIS IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS AND WHEN YOU SEE GET DELIVERY FOR FREE, AVOID AVOID AVOID. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO STRIPE YOU UP TO BECOME A CUSTOMER PAYING A MONTHLY FEE. I WISH WE COULD GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE RESTAURANTS HAD THEIR OWN DRIVERS INSTEAD OF USIBG THESE SERVICES, AS IT'S THE FOOD WE WANT. NOT THE MIDDLEMAN.

After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting (which I sat by the window 10 minutes prior to delivery time so I could watch for them) I  contacted deliveroo through their live chat and was told that she had spoken to the Gold Moon and the food would be with me in 5 mins. So 5 mins later I phoned Gold Moon myself. It seems they travel in a tardis to make their deliveries. I was told by a very rude and unhelpful man that the driver had in that 5 mins drove to my address, tried to contact me, then drove back to the restaurant and explained what had happened before I rang. Quite a miracle as its a 15 min round trip.I contacted deliveroo by email and attached screenshots of all communication and call logs which quite clearly prove the driver could never have been here. The next day I called deliveroo who were about as useful as a chocolate tea pot. The woman I spoke to had no interest in trying to help and just kept banging on about having to speak to the restaurant as they did their own deliveries. They needed to ask whether the food had been delivered according to them. Well of course they're going to say it has you dozy mare! And surprise surprise I received an email saying the restaurant had confirmed they had tried and therefore I wasn't entitled to a refund.Turns out the place has a reputation for taking payments and not delivering the I've since found out when I googled them. There are many reviews saying the same thing. In hindsight I should have payed more attention to the rating before I ordered. Then again you wouldn't expect a company as big as deliveroo to allow scamming, thieving businesses to trade through them.Anyway I contacted my bank and disputed the payment and got my money back.

This is below their costs, and means they’re actually loosing money to work with Deliveroo, who have so far refused to deal with them and even suspended their account for complaining. Looking on the internet there are various articles showing this is not an isolated case by some rogue employees or a coding error, but their actual business model during the pandemic. Whilst they know that many restaurants have no other route to market and are desperate, they’re just charging very high commission rates, knowing full well these companies are on their knees and unable to fight back. Without these partner companies, Deliveroo is nothing but this is how they treat them during a national crisis. And it gets worse, they also regularly see which restaurants are most successful in a given area and copy their menu with minor tweaks operating out of industrial units with their own ""exclusive brands"", so they can steal their market share as well as charge high levels of commission. Clearly this is to try and bolster profits prior to their up-coming IPO, but at what cost, effectively extorting small businesses who cannot fight back, absolutely disgusting and predatory. And reading other reviews here, I guess unsurprisingly they treat the riders poorly too.I've cancelled my premium account today and deleted the app and shown this to everyone I know, this kind of abusive way of running businesses makes me sick and I want no part of it.

She then told me that she would refund me £5.99 so I could re-order it, however I let her know £5.99 would cover the food but not delivery and service which I had already paid for initially when I ordered the food, so I wouldn’t be able to get it delivered for that price.After 5 minutes of arguing with me, she said she’ll speak to someone and put me on hold again for a few minutes, and then told me she could refund the delivery fee but not the service fee, I told her this is still unacceptable since I still would not be able to get the food delivered for that price.I then asked her why she couldn’t call the delivery driver and ask him if he could deliver the food if he still had it and she told me that it’s been 20 minutes now and the food would be bad quality. Which was terrible because the food that was sitting on the table had been there for 20 minutes while I was on the phone with her. If she had come up with that resolution in the first place when I had called her, it would have been good quality food and arrived a minute later than expected.The reason I got so annoyed in the first place is that I  only ordered from Pizza Hut for the nachos, the rest of it I didn’t care about that much. I would’ve ordered elsewhere if I knew I wouldn’t get the nachos.Overall very dissatisfied with the service, not only did I not get the nachos, I didn’t get the bare minimum refund so I could re-order them. Honestly after the inconvenience you would expect a good will gesture not an argument.Regards,Sean",2021-03-26 10:59,{1: 'Bad'}

They didn‘t look left nor right and kept on cycling wherever they want. I get the drivers want to be as fast as possible and are under time pressure, but it‘s a huge safety hazard because the cyclist usually come out of the middle of nowhere, they are quick and usually don‘t even see or watch out for pedestrians. For the service: ordered twice, the drivers were always friendly and thankful about tips. Once though we waited for four hours because the delivery vehicle broke down and they had to place a new order. That was a bummer, but the food was worth it. And to be fair, a competent Asian woman immediately called and there was transparency, but I‘d rather this did not happen. I would get a Deliveroo subscription, because they do have more restaurants than Justeat. My main concern though are the cyclists who don‘t care for human lives.

Last night was the last straw. We ordered food at 7p.m. and the deliveroo app gave us one hour waiting time. Which then stretched to almost 3 hours. The last notification I've received from deliveroo was saying that ""Alex"" was delivering our food at 9.50 p. M. After this, Alex went off the tracking system and so my dinner. A huge disappointment. I will never ever ever order with deliveroo again. That dinner was supposed to be the highlight of the week for us. Completely ruined by deliveroo.

Why should I pay for that exactly?Then they were hacked... I noticed a strange order appear to a new address, then another order to same place... So I got on the chat and and the call center person gave me 2 options.1: Live with the fact I'll be buying strangers food.2: They would close my account immediately. When asked should I call my credit card to reclaim the amount they had billed me they reluctantly said they would refund me. I guess they didn't want to incur the fees my CC would charge them for a disputed transaction. Oh and if you want to use deliveroo after you need to get a new email address to register with...What I also noticed was in early days they wanted to help with problems, fast forward a few years and when you discover chicken in your vegetarian dish they make life difficult. You need to photo the problem, then 24 hours late they complain the photo doesn't clearly show it chicken can you send another zoomed in... yes of cause I kept in in my fridge just in case...

All that wasn't too bad. But what was unacceptable to me was that the server I was speaking to disconnected the chat while I was still in it. I was not unresponsive for a long time. In fact, they had disconnected the minute they sent the last message. Even if they were to disconnect, they should have sent a message saying they were going to. Live customer service chats aren't innovative to Deliveroo. How come other companies, whether it'd be internet providers, phone companies, online shopping sites, have managed to use live chats successfully but not Deliveroo?Upon reaching out through email I was also ignored until now. They wasted no time in sending promotional emails during that time though. Obviously, you can tell what's important to them. And I trust that the delay is not because they haven't had time to reply but because they straight up don't care what concerns I'm having.Anyway, 9 days later I never got a refund or email confirmation. So of course, I contacted their live chat again. I was told that the refund had actually been added to my account as credit but that they will redirect it to my bank account.I didn't know such poor customer service still existed nowadays as I had been using other services.This all happened during their $1 delivery promo and now I know why they needed it.Lesson: don't expect much from cheap things.",2021-03-15 08:46,{1: 'Bad'}

What makes me mad is why accept the order. Two emails saying we will not refund you as they think i am lying about this.

Absolutely not. Do they try to resolve the issue? Nope just offer a generic apology and take your money. Now they’re telling me to email support to get my money back after get another order with missing items as they’re unable to refund me. Why can’t supermarkets mark items as out of stock so I’m not charged for them? Why don’t the drivers check if all items are there before leaving the store?

Deliveroo,60463132f85d750394240468,604631031c1cb5001911a9c5,Deliveroo's IPO is going to be interesting...,"Based on my recent experience with Deliveroo it feels like a company in real trouble desperately trying to make the numbers stack up for their IPO. I have used Deliveroo a lot over lockdown, and have happily paid for their Deliveroo Plus subscription for the last six months or so.The service was generally pretty good, but occasionally things go wrong. That's fine, I understand that. They were generally pretty good at fixing things when they did - until recently.I had a series of orders go wrong: one driver claimed not to be able to find my building, and claimed he had called me, and just disappeared with £50+ of curry. Another driver delivered a £20 order to an entirely different building. ""OK, sure, whatever,"" I thought. ""Not a big issue, as when this sort of stuff happens Deliveroo are good at sorting it out.""How wrong can you be? Both times, Deliveroo refused to refund me for these, claiming their T&Cs meant *I* was at fault. After much back and forth I finally got the refunds. That was the point that the warning signs began to appear. Problem is, it's convenient. ""I'll give them another chance,"" I thought. BAD IDEA. Things have gone from bad to worse.The final straw was when I ordered some groceries from the Coop - everything came except a £3 box of blueberries. Fine, no problem. I reported it as missing in the app - previously when something similar had happened (some salmon missing) I reported it in the app and they simply corrected the amount billed to my card. Not this time: I got an email telling me that they were not going to refund me for this. No reason why. I queried this. Still no reason given. I told them that I was insisting in on a refund and would not give up.I then got an email from one of their customer service reps threatening to terminate my Deliveroo Account and implying that I'd previously made fraudulent claims. Interesting, given that *every single time* I had an issue I sent them photographs and they refunded me without quibbling, until the past few weeks. I told them that if they were going to allege I was breaching their T&Cs they should send me that evidence - and if they could not, I expected the £3 refund within 72 hours. £3 refund came through.Now, obviously I wasted WAY more than £3 of my time on this. But the thing is, why should a company promise to deliver something, bill you on that basis - and then when they don't send something they promised, claim that you should still be billed in full? That makes me really furious. First time it was £50 of curry, second time it was £20 of wine, third time it was £3 of blueberries. I can understand the £50 hit - no company wants to have lots of those. But £3 of blueberries: that's the price they put on my loyalty as a long standing, moderately high-spending customer, and clearly that's what their brand equity is worth.£3.Pathetic.I'm assuming this is them trying to tighten things up in the run up to their IPO, and the customer service team have been told to aggressively dispute everything to increase revenue. Doesn't bode well for the post-IPO status of the company if they have to use dishonest tactics like this in order to protect revenues.It'll be interesting to see what price the stock floats at - as it will surely be hugely overvalued based on this. You can be aggressive with your customers for a couple of months, but when you absolutely destroy customer trust and loyalty the business is built in shakey foundations.I've now cancelled my Deliveroo Plus membership and will move my spend elsewhere.",2021-03-08 14:14,{1: 'Bad'}

It's sole purpose is to squeeze money from you by operating close to boundaries of the law. Probably breaking the law 99% of the time because they mislead you on order time a lot of the time. It's Friday, they are short on riders but inform you of usual 20min delivery time from local KFC on the app (which now I know it's not true)... but really they know they can't achieve this and delivery would take more than an hour or more. On this occasion they have already taken nearly 2 hours. I am still waiting. I wanted to cancel but they are refusing to refund because apparently KFC is already prepping my order.It's like dealing with a dodgy street market seller. That's very much their business not to mention how they mistreat their workers paying them next to nothing.My GF and I have probably ordered on 3 occasions with Deliveripoo on a Friday... and always they fail. After two fails, we should have known better... we placed the order at 6.45pm thinking we missed the queue, it's now 8.45pm.... and Deliveripoo have extended delivery time by another 10mins for the 11th time...

I go on live chat and ask them to cancel the order and they say they can't because KFC already has my order.I ask them what to do about the extra £10 I've just been charged and they flat out refuse to help - I have a joint bank account with my wife and apparantly she's ordered using her own card before, which means my deliveroo account and hers are judged to be the same account.Tried explaining that we weren't notified of any stipulations with the order not being able to use a bank account that's been used before, and that if I was really doing this to scam a tenner I wouldn't be asking for the order to be cancelled completely, but the agent kept trying to terminate the chat after not getting a response every 30 seconds.Couldn't even reject the delivery at the door as the doorbell rang, and as soon as I got to it the driver was already in his car driving away. To cap it off, food was stone cold and had items missing. No one would willingly pay nearly £40 for a KFC for 3 people, let alone one that was freezing. Going to open a claim with the bank and won't use deliveroo again. Crap service at unreasonable prices, Just Eat isn't much better service wise but is a hell of a lot cheaper for the same food!Also, check through the other reviews, this isn't the first time they've screwed over customers with promo codes.

Deliveroo, a refund is when a company returns the money a customer has spent with them directly to that customer, because the service or goods that were purchased were either unavailable at source, defective, incorrect at delivery, or simply didn't arrive.It is illegal in the UK to withhold a refund from customers with a genuine reason and argument in favour of having their money returned. The payment should be returned directly to the customer using the method they paid with, i.e. credit card, cash, debit card or bank transfer, or whichever method the client chooses, within 14 days of the initial transaction.

An hour after the estimated delivery time had been and gone and there was still no sign of the food (the restaurant refused to answer the phone), we managed to get through to Deliveroo's customer service. We requested a refund for the meal, which the Deliveroo employee agreed to. During this conversation, the order updated to say that it had been delivered - it had not. By this point it was so late in the evening that we ordered another meal, which arrived on time. Cut to the present; since then (nearly 2 weeks ago now) I've been in a very long email battle to receive compensation for that disastrous first order. Despite providing them with screenshots of the conversation that I'd had with the Deliveroo employee that evening, I've been refused any form of compensation beyond ""we're sorry that happened to you"".I have been told that ""the restaurant uses their own riders and you would have been notified of this at checkout"". Even if you're a Plus member a ""service fee"" is still taken for Deliveroo - surely then you have responsibilities to provide said service? I have also been told no on the grounds of the restaurant's delivery confirmation - hard to prove otherwise but a blatant and total dismissal of my complaint versus the restaurant providing false information (even when captured in screenshots)? I've argued my case, but have been refused multiple times.Honestly? I personally despise confrontation and have never in my life left a public review like this, but the treatment I've experienced as a long-standing Deliveroo Plus customer is shocking.As of today, I've cancelled my subscription.",2021-02-22 12:11,{1: 'Bad'}

Customer services on Live chat stated that they can't do anything else in this case and to email support, not what you want to hear after intentionally ordering food as your busy and do not be inconvenienced with cooking instead I find myself on the phone line which is screeching loud as can be and providing my email for a solution, Lady was very decent but still her decency isn't what's under review here, it's the company that is. (Spoke to Tacobell too the guy literally said Deliveroo are lying if they are saying they cant do anything.)Time before this was shocking, the lid had popped off the curry it had spilt everywhere we initially got offered a refund which we could only spend with Deliveroo again no solution to a meal that we actually wanted to eat in the moment. And the other time we ordered a food shop which had items missing we ordered it so we didn't need to the shops because of Corona Virus but yeah had to go down anyways to grab the missing items. One was a key ingredient to a meal so... I get none of this is ""The end of the world"" but if we think about why we get a take away...- minimize inconvenience - instant satisfaction- because your hungry at the time Not one of these boxes are ticked messing up 3/5 times is not okay and when you take in mind the inconvenience of having to complain... Call up the phone number... and the time you actually spend on the phone with them if you actually value your time and your experiences it just really doesn't sit well.

Deliveroo,602c41e0679d9708b4d89053,602c4153b1558c001aad0e5b,Deliveroo are running a big scam be careful with bad customer service,"For the past few month deliveroo has been taking £11.49 from my account for no reason and when I ask them why, they aren’t even able to give me a reason for this transaction ? At first i contacted them last month after i noticed theweird transaction. When i first contacted the customer service he had the audacity to tell me they didn’t take anything. Even though i have the proof in my bank statement it made absolutely no sense. But since i was busy i decided to just wait and see if they would dare do this again in January. And of course like the shameless scammers that they are; they did ! So this time i emailed customer service again, but this time i was not going to let them play with me, i pulled up with receipts, screenshots, everything. At first they kept asking me for the same documents again and again, i think it was to make me lose my time so i would give up, little do they know i am unemployed i will get my £11.49, i don’t have anything better to do. So i kept sending the receipts they were asking + the one they asked previously to make sure they couldn’t ask it again. Eventually all the documents had been given, but of course the scammers still found a way to delay it by asking me if the transaction was still showing in my bank app? Now i have heard a lot of stupid questions in my days but if you haven’t refunded me my money and you have screenshots of the transaction AND official transaction receipt, how in god’s name fo you expect the transaction to be gone? Again i gave them all the information they needed but they’ve been taking their sweet time . As i am writing this review i still didn’t get my refund. I looked around the internet to see what people thought about this big joke of a delivery service. And online i found so many people complaining of the exact same thing : -taking money for no reason -horrendous customer service So my question is: if we are all being scammed by deliveroo, why are we allowing this to happen ? I’m not the first one that get scammed by deliveroo and then receive horrible costumer service in response (clearly  just people trying to make you waste time and think you’re an gullible idiot ) so we should do something about this. Are you guys trying to sue ? I feel like we deserve reparation for the emotional damage deliveroo has caused and they should be charged with fraud. I am ready to fight deliveroo, i will get my £11.49 or die trying. Don’t play with me in the middle of a pandemic, i’m broke and i have time, it’s a bad combo deliveroo! The only reason i put one star is because i can’t put 0. So if you’re thinking of creating a deliveroo account it’s not worth it, they will steal your money mess up your order and when you try to complain you’ll be met with extreme incompetence. Use Uber Eats instead they are real ones, they might mess up some times but their customer service is bomb!",2021-02-16 22:06,{1: 'Bad'}

Now Deliveroo is refusing to issue the refund claiming they cannot reach the restaurant to verify this. They squarely blamed me for ordering from a restaurant that does its own delivery.

Called Deliveroo to complain and ask for 3 more pizzas to be delivered so that these amazing volunteers don't go hungry - 'sorry, we can't. We need to investigate first and this can take up to 48 hours.' So when asked if these 3 volunteers were going to be left hungry because they refused to authorise 3 pizzas, there was no useful response.  Deliveroo - you can afford 3 pizzas whilst you do your investigations.  Especially for people who are coming out in the freezing cold to help others during this very difficult time.  To say I am appalled and disgusted is a HUGE understatement. You need to review your bureaucratic processes and learn to do the right thing.

Not much use when you’re hungry. I checked the app the next morning and saw a credit for the pizza was there - I’d received no email, message, etc to let me know this.So I spoke to someone on live chat and requested a credit for the redundant pizza dip too. I was told that as that was not damaged, they would not offer credit. That person then cut me off and another came on. I said to this person that if they wouldn’t credit me the dip then I wanted a refund for the pizza instead as would not be using Deliveroo again. This person said they would’ve have redelivered another pizza that night so wouldn’t credit dip. When I advised the app message said a 2 day response time, his reaction was ‘oh’ - he then processed me a refund rather than a credit.Seems crazy to lose a regular customer over £1.50.

I made my first ever account with Deliveroo after finding they delivered in my area and used my boyfriends card with his permission to order a Nando’s after a tiring day. I applied my discount for £10 off £15 and processed the payment on the order screen, an error message came up mid way through advised that I did not meet the criteria for the promo code and that it was being removed, at this point you be expected to be redirected to the payment screen to review the new payment and then proceed just to make sure you can confirm and agree that price? WRONG! It bumped the price up by £10 mid transaction and took more than originally quoted on the payment screen. I tried to cancel, it would not allow me to cancel. I called to speak to someone who just referred me back to T&C’s which did not help, I asked her if I can cancel and she simply said “no” and the reason I wasn’t able to use the discount is because the card I used has been used on a Deliveroo order before, 4 years ago my partner ordered a McDonald’s at work and used his card to pay for it. I appreciate on that basis the card was recognised as a prior card used on their system making me ineligible for the discount, but I expected once the error message flagged up advising I wasn’t eligible it would cancel the transaction and let me check my order as I didn’t consent to that price.Complaint reviewed by Sheila who referred me to T&C’s again as to why I wasn’t eligible, even though that isn’t the issue. The issue is an unauthorised payment being taken from the account!I then spoke to a manager who explained that they cannot issue me a refund of £10 as I did not print screen the order showing £19.64 which why would I?

We recieved a call at 8:43 (possibly from the rider) who perhaps could not hear us, although we could hear noise from his side. We called back but there was no answer. We went outside our flat during this cold rainy night and stood outside for 5 minutes thinking the rider may be lost. But there was no sign of him.We came back up to our flat and checked status online which said the food was delivered at 8:40pm. Bizzare and fraustrated, we called Deliveroo. After waiting 15 mins for someone to pick up, a representative picked up. She initially tried to help and spoke to the driver, who told her that he was sent to a wrong address and no one picked up his call. And that he made way to his second delivery. I kept my calm, until the representative (who sounded like reading scripted lines) tried to get me to order again as last order appeared to be ""delivered"". But, the restautant closed by then. She kept repeating the same thing when my simply question was: why did the rider lie that he delivered the food? and why did he not try to contact us for the second time or even try to simply use google map to find our flat. We placed order using web browser and not the app, and it is not the customer's fault that Deliveroo's web browser does not allow for pin drops like the app! The representative first tried to place the blame on us although our address was perfectly written on the order. After staying on call for 20 minutes, she just told me that she and the company is ""sorry"" for the inconvinience. There was no offer to redirect the order and by the time I left the phone it was too late to order from any other shops. Because of deliveroo, our friday night has been ruined.

I told the customer service again that this is not acceptable and demanded to be refunded which they did at the end after talking to their senior manager.

I had been using Deliveroo for around a year and until this point had no reason to raise a complaint even if the service or delivered food was less than perfect.Firstly when I described the abundantly obvious problem it was clear I was talking to an automated bot for the first five minutes.  Canned responses.  Fine.  Eventually I got through to a person.  In summary these are the reasons for a 1* review:1.  The chat was ended four times by the assistants whilst I was typing answers to their questions, so I had to start again.  Eventually committing 35mins of my life to this but felt I was a the point of not return!2.  I had no response in over 24 hours to my complaint.  3.  Worst of all the last assistant seemed to be doing her best to patronise and downplay before telling me my problem doesn't fall into their refund policy.  If it didn't then what on Earth does?I didn't need a full refund.  All I wanted was a gesture and I would have forgotten it and ordered again the next day.  @Deliveroo....this tells me....your people are not good enough.

Even though I had an account with deliveroo I never used them due to cost. I favoured Just Eat. Just Eat, though, started delivering very unreliably so I decided to try Deliveroo. My first order with them was on 19th November and then I had 10 more orders with them. During that time period I never contacted them in any shape way or form other than for the delivery order. However, I was happy with their service and started trialing premium membership. I'm front line NHS worker and things were tough a week at the hospital so I was relying on delivered food. On the 9th of Jan I had my 11th order with Deliveroo but my card payment kept being declined. I thought the bank blocked my account and so I contacted them and they told me it had nothing to do with them, they had approved the payment and the error was with Deliveroo and to contact them. Then I entered the twilight zone. As I came to find out Deliveroo has no direct number and you can only contact via chat. Via chat they told me they would look into it and they would get back to me via email within 2 working days. I said this was not resolving my problem as I needed to order food then and why was I paying for premium membership. They said they would look into it. Again then they said they would get back to me via email in 2 working days. I said I was unhappy with this and I would cancel my membership, which I did. Thank the gods that happened to be just in time of the trial period so I never paid them the extra membership money. I then forgot about them as I saw customer service was non existent and went happily about my life. I also did not hear back from them within working days but I could also care less. Until today. Today they sent me the email attached below. Given that I never asked them for a refund and have never contacted them in the past to compliment, complaint, or even on error, I find this to be a highly harassing email from a service I had already let go.

Deliveroo,600ec637679d97067cf9a5a2,56fe3fce0000ff000a1382e2,Appalled by today’s service.,"Appalled by today’s service. I ordered food for some family members who have COVID with their mom admitted in intensive care and dad too ill to cook for their 3 children (all under 18 with the youngest one 5 and the middle one with learning difficulties). Between order and delivery, it took 2 hours. I ordered well in advance so they will have food in time but this was not the case. I’m sure we all know how angry, grumpy and sad being hungry makes us, so imagine how a child will feel. No child should have to wait for their food, we’re not asking for charity! Deliveroo proposed around £6 credit to my account for this. Money won’t change anything but it, of course, definitely helps. I requested Deliveroo to either provide more credit or 50% the next order as I will need to order for their food until their mom comes back (I don’t live near them otherwise I would have made and delivered the food myself). I made this request on the basis that Deliveroo is always giving its customers random discount etc. And surely this wouldn’t have put them out of pocket but this would have been regarded as a nice gesture. I use Deliveroo quite often, but this is the last time I’ll be using Deliveroo. So utterly disappointed.",2021-01-25 13:23,{1: 'Bad'}

They thought it perfectly acceptable to refund the rice and I could eat a curry without. My daughter and I ordered a meal on Saturday from a new outlet. The meal arrived over 30 minutes after expected time. The containers were on their side, liquid had spilt over all contents. The food was lukewarm and not our order. We rang deliveroo to be told we would be credited with the cost of the meal. There is never any offer of compensation. We were left without a meal.

Firstly it’s actually cheaper if you order through the restaurant directly via their own website/phone. Secondly the customer service from deliveroo is SHOCKING. I ordered from them for the first time when I was 10 weeks pregnant. The food I got came fast and on time, however two of the dishes weren’t as they should have been. I know this isn’t deliveroos fault so I contacted the restaurant directly and they were really apologetic but said because I ordered through deliveroo I needed to peruse it through deliveroo. If I ordered from them directly they would have been able to sort directly for me. So I called the helpline for deliveroo and was told due to the circumstance the food was not acceptable, they would happily arrange a refund for the two (out of five) items i ordered. It was confirmed with a supervisor and I was told I’d receive an email within 5 working days regarding a refund. No email, so I contacted them again. They gave me an email to send to and apologised. No reply for two weeks. Once a reply was received they said they apologised for the wait and was forwarding my query to the relevant person(s). Again no response after that so I emailed again and again. A month later I receive an email from Starlet saying no refund would be processed and no reason why. Just a short blunt email. So I asked: why? I’ve been told I could get a refund, the restaurant was on board? To that, just another blunt email ‘we’ll use your experience for future reference’ This is absolutely by far the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced. Firstly recieving food that was off while I’m pregnant and having to throw the food away because I don’t want to risk the health of my unborn baby - which the restaurant has taken responsibility for and said they’d refund the money through deliveroo - but mostly because of the disgusting service from deliveroo. Don’t bother using them, waste of money and time. They don’t care, they’re rude and they lie. Oh, and they charge more than restaurant prices too.

So you're literally asking for it.Here's a couple of suggestions to make the experience better: 1. Stop putting members of my community at risk 2. Acknowledge and respond to requests for basic hygiene and health policy information3. Facilitate the delivery of the correct food order and ensure that food is warm (one job, et al)4. Respond to complaints with customer service, not with an automated droid5. If you do have to use an automated droid then don't try and hide it6. Serious complaints team should try and acknowledge the actual complaint 7. Serious complaints team should avoid calling me 'Starlett' when responding to the serious complaint - the name of your automated droid8. Respond to data protection requests and avoid sending surveys to disgruntled customers who have made aforementioned requests. So yea, work on that. It's not that I have a particular problem with the name Starlett - I quite like it. It suits me. It's more the absurdity of it's use when a member of the serious complaints team (SCT) uses it. It is the equivalent of a member of the flying squad on the Sweeny kicking in the door and yelling ""FREEZE!"" then realising he got his service weapon mixed up with a sex toy.The part that makes me smile is that Starlett is the name of the automated droid responding to the customer complaints. So the crack member of the SCT (I am assuming an expert) not only didn't read my complaint, or absorb the most basic information, (like my name) but also didn't know enough about Deliveroids customer relationship management process to recognise the name of the droid they are mugging me off with!This now makes it a member of the Sweeny kicking in a door, service weapon mixed up with a sex toy, realising the door leads to the set of Pat Sharp's Fun House instead of a crime scene.

Deliveroo your behaviour towards customers is abysmal we are the reason you exsist! My review is based on the delivery of 'stone cold' food on New Years Eve for which Deliveroo were the delivery service. We purchased a meal from our local Wagamama and as soon as it arrived it was unpacked/served where we realised it was cold and so I called Wagamama to advise them and they offered either a replacement meal or a refund we went for the latter. Deliveroo customer service have contacted us twice and they signed off by saying ""we'll do better next time""- what next time???? We've asked you to make right on our order and to date you have not we will not use your service ever again and you should look to your competitors as an example of providing a decent level of service to their customers",2021-01-10 19:44,{1: 'Bad'}

We wasn’t contacted via phone call either. Their only solution was to wait another 40 minutes for a re delivery which would have meant a delivery at around 21:30. It was Such a disappointment.  We will not be using deliveroo if we decide to order food In again.

They don't allow you to complain more than once as they consider it a breach of their rules. They deliver cold food almost as a constant and have zero interest in resolving the issues. The drivers are paid a pittance and Deliveroo also rip the restaurants and cafes off by charging them up to 45% of the amount you pay - so they get over half the amount we pay for the takeaway. Let us all try and work with the restaurants and cafes and cut these vile and evil companies out. BTW, the tips you leave for the poor driver is taken by them and they remove a handling charge etc....usual sharp practices and as a multinational company, they also pay zero tax in the UK.

Deliveroo,5fed5671755dc1032c081b59,5fed556476582900197912f2,"Deliveroo service is flawed, thus bad","The Deliveroo delivery service is based upon non-employees taking rides selected by their software to deliver food. Up to this point, it is ok, as it works well in other countries. However, the riders are not properly vetted, trained or accountable for the service they provide.I have lived in two distinct areas of Greater London, one in zone 6 and another in zone 2. The service varies largely. In zone 6, you could say it is just alright. You get your food delivered, well packed and within good time. I only had occasional riders that were too lazy to come to my door and would rather deliver in reception.When I moved to zone 2, it was utterly terrible. 9 out of 10 deliveries had problems. Some were the restaurant's fault with missing or bad items, but most of them were with riders doing a myriad of mistakes up to the point of cancelling deliveries twice in a row!They are occasionally rude and most of the times lazy enough to even take the lift.I understand they have many deliveries and are paid little, but their job has to be fulfilled in full. If they do it correctly, they do not deserve a tip because it is their job. If they do it well enough, they are entitled albeit not required to be tipped.These problems happen and are getting out of hand of that Deliveroo mostly employ illegal immigrants that use borrowed or rented accounts. No vetting is done, and if they do wrong, there is simply no real accountability besides some app restriction towards more work and account cancellation. If they were at least contractors, properly registered and stuff, there would be accountability for their mistakes.Let's be frank here. This is one of the meagre jobs that a lot of people get to live by. I don't want to generalise as some people are genuinely doing good work and are honest, but come on. If you are not legally resident here, you are breaking the law, so can't expect better from these people.I am an immigrant myself, fully registered and legally employed, and think what many riders do is despicable at best.Well, away from my rant, I believe that Deliveroo is responsible for employing such people that do not have proper morals and work ethics. Therefore they deserve this review more than the riders themselves.The downside is that since there is little competition in my borough, I kind of have to suck it up. But certainly, when I move again, I will stop using their services altogether even if it means going for takeaways myself. Making money whatever means necessary is ugly and despicable at best!

It’s such a shame that a few bad delivery riders ruin the reputation of Deliveroo. I will put it down to the driver not the company or restaurant. The worst service I have ever received from a delivery service. I am in Hereford. This is the email I sent to Deliveroo which explains what happened last night. Avoid if you don’t want to be ripped off and treated appallingly. Order 1888/9401Hello,I had a delivery from you yesterday & I received the worst service I have ever received from a delivery company ever. I ordered my food from Pizza Hit order Number 1888 and when the delivery driver left the restaurant I watched him come close to my property but could see he had difficulty locating me. The driver telephoned me and unfortunately despite me & my mother desperately trying to guide him he claimed not to be able to find me. I watched him drive very close to my property but then drive off and the next thing I knew it said on tracker my order had been delivered. I telephoned & spoke to a very nice polite member of your staff who apologised and said he would reorder the food with a different driver order number 9401. I then watched as my order was “prepared” and then left restaurant. Again the driver couldn’t find my property apparently despite my house clearly showing where it was on tracker. I was asked to telephone him which I did and again had problems communicating so I said I would go up the road and find him. It was pouring with rain so I was soaked by the time I returned with my food. When I opened the pizzas & sides you could tell that it was the original order which had been attempted to be reheat. The food was inedible and I had to put the food in the bin. I am so angry as I had family around for Xmas and was treating them to some food. I waited almost 2 hrs for food that was inedible and almost cold. I order regularly from just eat, Uber eats & Deliveroo & I have never had such terrible service and I am not happy. What makes all this worse is I was using a gift voucher from my Mum & Dad to pay for this awful food. I can’t see myself using your service again in the future as you don’t expect to pay over £50 for food, wait for 2 hrs almost and also have to go out and find your driver, getting wet for the trouble. I have always been very happy using your service but you ruined my Xmas get together before we all lock down again. Mark Davies.",2020-12-24 13:32,{1: 'Bad'}

This has happened with another delivery company and they were happy to honour the discount. Why would i choose to put further money into a company to use my discount? If the discount was honoured i would of likely purchased again through them, but now there's no chance.IF YOUR DEALING WITH CUSTOMERS, CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS PRIORITY, THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL DELIVEROO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2020-12-14 21:20,{1: 'Bad'}

I explained we did not want the pizza anymore and they are not to deliver it. At 22:00 they called to say the pizza was outside . We asked them to go away. We complained to deliveroo , who said we could not get a refund because we did not let them know before hand, which we did. So we have to pay for a meal they delivered 5 hours late . This is all due to deliveroo system crashing and providing no simple capability to cancel the order. Therefore beware if deliveroo have an IT issue the customer is at fault.

Easy enough to order but annoying that all products were inflated in price, plus large delivery charge, service charge of 5% on top plus they want you to tip the driver!! But needs must when you can’t get out of the house. I paid almost £20 for 2 pizzas, some coke, antibacterial wipes, bread & milk!!! Once the order arrived the driver left it on the doorstep for me which I asked in the notes as I was self isolating, which was great!! I noticed they had sent the wrong item. Unable to get hold of anyone from Deliveroo apart from to say an item was incorrect which they refunded into my account to credit.I didn’t want credit as had no intention of using the service again.Emailed 3 times (this was about a month ago now) to say I wanted a refund instead of the credit and never got a reply. Phone lines always busy too! I then got an email saying ‘don’t forget to use your credit before it expires!!’ What an absolute joke!!I gave up and decided I’d use my credit tonight as I’m obviously never gonna get my money back.Ordered a subway, used my credit and put to the rest with my own money. It said order received and money taken out of my bank, delivery would be 20-30 mins. So like 45 mins pass and I look on my orders and see no order there? Money is still out of my bank so I rang subway who hadn’t received the order and was nothing they could do, told me to get hold of Deliveroo.DM’d Deliveroo on Twitter who are just ignoring everyone and still can’t get through on the phone!Horrendous customer service. Safe to say I’ll never be using the service again and I’m not holding my breath for a refund.Sticking with Uber eats!! Please don’t use them it’s daylight robbery, and if they don’t want to refund you they just won’t.

I was very surprised to see that my ordered had a delivered status. We then try to call the customer service. This is the worse customer service I have ever heard. They were not helpful at all. They said to me your food was delivered at that address and we tried to call you on your number. I never received any call, se one the address was clearly mentioned and no one never even bothered to try to ring the bell. One day later, I received the following message from someone named Olivia:Hi ...,As we previously let you know, we are unable to offer you compensation for this order.Honestly this is the worse delivery company.

I decided to give it ago and they checked that on my bank account they decided to charge extra £3.5 for delivery!!! No notification on price change. Just charged with the extra fee!

On Friday evening, 27 November at about 6pm, we ordered a meal from Five Guys which didn't turn up.

I ran down the stairs and while on the doorstep, I received a message to state our order would be left on the doorstep. The only thing on the doorstep was me and no Deliveroo rider or food to be seen. When I rang Customer Service I asked her to speak to the driver. She said she did and that he had definitely rung the intercom. If he was close by he could have come back - it was literally a few minutes after he said he was here. I was offered a re-delivery which we received 15mins later minus all the fries. It was in a bag that had a completely different order ticket on it for a completely different address. When I rang again to complain, I was cut-off. I have since emailed and only received a generic email in response. The difficulty in getting in touch is a sign that they can't cope with all the complaints re their bad service.

This is understandable, it can happen. However, it did kind of ruin our overall meal, and we did expect some sort of compensation. The rep we spoke to offered the menu value of the item *as credit*. I expressed that i thought it would be fair to get 20-30% of the bundle value refunded, as the item was relatively cheap but important for enjoying the more expensive dishes (i.e., it was a dry carb to go with an expensive wet main). The reason i'm giving one star is that 3 times the rep just ended the conversation when i refused to accept the menu value. To be clear, i remained polite and respectful the whole time. I had to re-explain the situation 3 times, which further took away from my Saturday evening. I felt like they were purposefully doing this, which is extremely frustrating.

This is very annoying because the extra 20mins (at least) means that you get your order ice cold. The guy before you paid exactly the same as you, so it's like a lottery. Sometimes you get your order on time, and sometimes ""rider is delivering another order first"" and suddenly you have to wait an extra 20-30mins and you can be sure it's going to be cold. You should be able to accept (before paying) whether you want your delivery guy to deliver other orders first, and should be cheaper, like if you share an Uber.

They checked, admitted fault and were profusely apologetic and advised me to contact Deliveroo to be refunded. I contacted Deliveroo and was quite frankly appalled at the lack of customer care. I couldn't tell whether I was speaking to a human or a robot - the advisor was that robotic. They loosely apologised for the inconvenience but refused a refund. Really Deliveroo?! I called back to speak with another advisor to see if they could assist, but no - the same robotic, useless approach: loose apology and no offer of a refund.I should point out that I have a serious gluten allergy and I could have been admitted to hospital had I ate the food. Clearly Deliveroo think they are above the law and think that an incorrect order when an allergy is involved is acceptable practices. It is not, and is quite frankly dangerous.Deliveroo's approach, or lack thereof, is startling.

A dish on Deliveroo can cost about £4 more than it does direct from the restaurant. Then you've got the delivery fee which can be about £4 and the service charge is up to £2 now. If you take say a £10 burger and chips, it can land up costing you double on Deliveroo!On top of this there's the optional tip for the restaurant (no - you've already tipped yourselves by marking up your prices) AND the optional tip for the delivery driver. I have to say I never ever tip either. I feel bad for the delivery guys because I really don't have anything against them, but once I've paid the mark-up, the delivery fee and the service charge, I just can't do it; I'm not made of money.The 'offers' advertised on the site are also very misleading. I'm constantly seeing 'free delivery' everywhere but what they mean is, if you subscribe to their monthly thing AND spend over £25, THEN delivery is free. I don't know who's getting what money exactly but from a customer's point of view I feel it's kind of a rip-off.

Then, 3 days later, I get told I will be refunded only for the amount of the missing item. Useless as I had to order another take away and therefore the whole order should have been refunded. Also this refund will take another 5-10 days to arrive. So I’m out of pocket forever and even the tiny refund may not arrive until 2 weeks after my order.

I have had one instance where they didn't refund me for a case where they should have, but the rest of my interactions with them has made up for it.The last place I lived was not properly registered on maps, which made getting drivers to my door a ball ache. Every single time I had to contact them to say their GPS had taken them on the wrong road. It wasn't their fault, it was the landlord's fault for not registering the address properly. Unfortunately, most of the drivers didn't have a good grasp of English so the language barrier made this communication harder. I'm pretty sure one driver even had a panic attack, as after 20 minutes of trying to explain to them, they turned up to my door with an entourage of Deliveroo drivers holding their hand. I'm not joking, a literal Deliveroo convoy of 2 bikes and a car. I live somewhere much better now, and every delivery has been smooth as butter.While there seems to be some legitimate complaints in other reviews, trust me when I say 95% of them are from people who don't have 2 braincells to rub together.

Fair enough- it happens, but I wasn’t able to get in contact with them to let them know this is the case. I am happy with them bringing it to me later or refunding money to my bank account (and not a deliveroo credit).I don’t want to seem harsh, but it wasn’t like after over an hour of waiting for these few products from coop that they couldn’t have double checked that everything was there.

The person on the end of the online chat was abrupt and clearly just wanted to get rid of me, and tried twice to leave the chat even though I was still asking questions.I had raised a complaint to follow this with them, and despite an automatic response that they would respond within 24 hours I have heard nothing since (4 days later).I do not intend to use their service again.

When I tried to enquire it then took a further 45 mins with chat/calls with Wagamama blaming Deliveroo and vice Versa.

Deliveroo,5fa59f505e693f0acce1c8dd,5fa59f32d550110019a1b7d8,I have just had a very bad experience…,"This is the first negative food review I have felt the need to write as I am an extremely positive individual whom always tries to see both sides of a story and understands that everything can't be perfect right! However I strongly believe that writing this review is a good use of my valuable time to raise awareness amongst others! I have just had a very bad experience with deliveroo. I made an online order for a food delivery (dinner after returning home from a hard day at work lecturing in Health and Social Care during this COVID pandemic on the first day of the second lockdown) and the food I ordered never arrived. However I did receive an email from them stating that the food had arrived. So I made contact with them via their live chat online to discuss. First of all the chat operator stated that the food had been delivered, when I asked why the delivery guy did not ring my doorbell (white doorbell with my name clearly written on in which I stated in my order comments when placing my order) she then changed her comments and stated that actually the driver could not find my address so the food was not actually delivered, therefore he send me a message through the App to let me know. However I have not downloaded the App on to my mobile, I placed my order online via their website on my laptop so I did not see the message they stated that the driver send via the App. Deliveroo stated that I was not going to be given a refund because the driver delivered the food... even though we now know that he didn't because he couldn't find my address. I have written evidence that I screened shot from the live chat which shows the full content of the conversation that I had with the chat operator. I asked to speak with a manager and I asked for a name she stated she couldn't give me one. So I asked for a copy of the complaints policy and she referred me to the website to check out its terms and conditions which I did.  No where in their terms and conditions does it state that if the driver cannot find the address that the food ordered would be referenced/deemed as delivered and that you don't get your money back. I live a few roads away from the restaurant which the food was meant to be coming from. Its not a difficult address to find - infact its a well known address in my area - just of the Wandsworth Bridge Road in Fulham London, a simple house with a door number - on a simple road all clearly signposted with road signs and names... however according to deliveroo the driver could not find it. If the driver had a sat nav or mobile phone that is all that is required for him to find my address, he just needs to punch my postcode into whatever device he has right? and BANG he has my address, but it appears that was too much of a difficult challenge for him to do.  Deliveroo does not make any effort or attempt to direct a lost delivery driver to the right address, you would expect a delivery company to have some sort of procedure in place for that no? a quick chat with a lost driver on his mobile right, but no, that does not happen! You would assume that this would be something that deliveroo staff do to support their delivery drivers from a secure location in front of a computer, anywhere in an office or in someone's living or bedroom at home during lockdown right, as it doesn't seem too be much of a difficult task but they do not do this. So now I have to find the resources within my cupboard to make a last minute quick dinner for my children after a full on day at school for them and a full on day at work for me, children are already in their PJs. I don't want to risk getting them changed from their PJ's into thier day clothing to have to take them outside with me (because they are too young to leave at home alone) to the shops to buy food for dinner on the first day of the second lockdown. Let this be a warning to you all, please think twice about the company you use to deliver your food during lockdowns... it might not ever arrive and when you wonder why and approach the company to challenge why? they will tell you different stories and lie. They are dishonest, and function with the belief that if the driver doesn't know the address than that is an ok excuse to state that the food that has been delivered and use it as an excuse not to give you a refund as if its your fault and not theirs or the drivers who is not sat nav savy. I have all the written evidence from my chat with the online operator which I have screen shot with my mobile phone - I have also approached a well known newspaper to raise my concerns especially after reading all the other reviews on here about the negative experience they had too, very similar to mine. Shame on them!!!!  I will not be using them again. I ordered at 5pm. its now 7.05pm. Still haven't had a dinner and I have a hungry household.",2020-11-06 19:09,{1: 'Bad'}

First time using Deliveroo and definitely won't be using it again. I live in an apartment block with coded gates etc to get in.

I received a notification on the app that my order had arrived but no sign of the driver. I received a message from the driver just saying "" Hello "". I replied with ""I am on the main road beside the gate and gave him/her even more helpful directions"" I was across from a garage so it easy to find me. I waited some more but no delivery. I called the driver twice... no answer. Then all of a sudden, the app notifies me that the driver couldn't contact me and that the food was left at my door. NONE OF WHICH WAS TRUE.

Consequently, Deliveroo were notified of the missing items and  the fact that they had been paid for but not received. It was stated that they would respond within two days, but they never did. Following an email response to their support email address several days later, it was stated (by them)  that  “ We can’t offer you credit right now. We will take your feedback on board and work on improving the experience next time. “I then requested to know why a reimbursement could not be made for products that had been paid for, but not received. I  have received two emails in response to those forwarded  previously, at separate intervals, stating that reimbursement could not be made, as a complaint was needful of having been made within two days  of receipt of the order, however, I  reminded them that I had responded immediately on receipt of the order directly via their   contact info on their website, in which I had highlighted the two items which had been omitted from the order.Having then received a reply which reiterated that as I had not made a complaint within a specific two days, then a reimbursement would not be applied, I am therefore of the impression that even though I had responded immediately, then  responses via their recommended website contact process cannot be adequately proved, which is what must have transpired in my  particular case, even though later alternative communications  forwarded by email, appear to be acceptable as  proof of their existence.Do they not have a process for acknowledging and recording customers' responses to missing items following the fast-track recommended contact route from their website?I cannot understand how a supposedly reputable company such as Deliveroo can cheat their customers in this way; failing to provide the goods paid for and then declining a reimbursement.It would be interesting to know how many other customers have been treated in such a shoddy manner.It is also of concern that reputable companies such as Morrison's and shortly Aldi will be placing delivery options in the hands of Deliveroo.Needless to say I have now unsubscribed from Deliveroo and shall never be ordering from them again due to their abysmal attitude to customers.Incidentally, I am in my seventies and a so-called vulnerable person, but still retain the wherewithal to fight my corner, but believe that it is absolutely abhorrent that there will be others, who will be unable to do so.",2020-11-06 15:06,{1: 'Bad'}

To be told that the operator on the phone had already requested a redelivery and couldn’t process the refund. To be clear I asked how long the re-delivery would take and after hearing, I was very clear that I did not want it and only wanted a refund.I was then on hold for the best part of 20 minutes throughout our call while the operator struggled to rectify the error and issue the refund.I was also then told that there would be no additional compensation despite wasting my time and losing complete trust in the service. My view here is this error is entirely down to the deliveroo service and it is not the restaurant's fault.After arranging alternative food, we then get a loud knock/ door bell ringing at our door at a late time with the replacement food delivery. We deliberately didn’t want the redelivery to avoid such loud unexpected noises while our young children had gone to bed.Altogether a poor experience that will lead me to avoid deliveroo in the future and the unhelpful support after the error of no food will leave me with only very poor opinions to share with my friends and colleagues.To top it off - the automated response said they would respond within 24 hours.....

Deliveroo had already hid their customer service number and only provide an email adresse if you wish to complain or need to have a go at them for their not so clever scamming scam.

To cut the long short the driver had gone AWOL so a new driver was found. Deliveroo gave me £2.50 compensation. It is because of how they have dealt with these problems I have awarded them 3 stars.

Deliveroo,5f9c54015e693f06a001a9dd,5f04a0598e78a7820556643a,Disappointing...,"First and only time I've used Deliveroo and what a disappointment.Just ordered a few essentials milk breads and toilet paper ect because they now deliver from our local Morrisons.. Anyway the toilet paper was the main thing ordered for the convenience anyway, this is the one thing they didn't deliver on topping it off with the rider just saying ""the only thing missing was the toilet paper"" no apologies or replacing for a different brand, just get a email saying we don't even get the money back, we simply get the amount credited to my account that has to be used by January.For a service that's supposed to be for convenience and ease all just seems pointless, considering this is my first experience with Deliveroo I can safely say it's also my last.",2020-10-30 17:57,{1: 'Bad'}
Deliveroo,5f9c2dd45e693f06a00180c5,5f9c2dce826b050019223641,An alternative service would wipe them out.,"I mistakenly ventured back to Deliveroo in a moment of weakness but NEVER EVER AGAIN. Food was burnt and cold and late, some achievement. Offered a credit, why do I want a credit from a company that cannot meet its obligations. Don't bother trying to get in touch with customer services, non existent.   Absolutely shoddy company who at the moment are more or less operating in a vacuum, the lack of competition means that they think that they can treat clients poorly. WILL GET NO MORE MONEY FROM ME.

Accessed Live Chat and was told that it was delivered Contact Free and has been left beside the doorstep by the driver before he left. (It wasn’t)I asked them to clarify the SOP for contactless deliveries to which they responded with the following: 1. You’ll receive a notification that the rider is near by, reminding you That your orders is to be delivered contact free. (Did not happen)2. When the rider arrives they will place your order in a thermal bag open at the place you indicated when placing your order. (Did not happen)3. Your rider will step back at least 1 metre and wait nearby for you to collect it. (Did not happen) By their own admission, their policy was not followed but despite this they still refused to accept responsibility. I reminded them that the order they claim to have left by the doorstep contained Alcohol and that as a result of not completing the delivery my age could not have possibly been verified. Advised me I’d be contacted by someone which never happened. Called a number I found and managed to get a refund after fighting for the best part of an hour.",2020-10-30 13:31,{1: 'Bad'}
Deliveroo,5f9c09f85e693f06a001592c,5ef70408a735503f865fe742,Disgraceful customer service,"We ordered food and the delivery driver didn't turn up. We could see him on the GPS but he wasn't even close. Then it said he failed to deliver the food, without calling or messaging. We called to find out what happened and they said we could have a refund, we thought they would redeliver the food but instead they didn't do anything and we were left hungry and wasted so much time. We called to explain what happened again and was put on hold for over ten minutes then disconnected and we had to call back again! Eventually they said they would give us £2. This doesn't even cover the cost for delivery. Terrible customer service especially considering how expensive food is through Deliveroo. I will not be using them anymore.",2020-10-30 12:41,{1: 'Bad'}
Deliveroo,5f9c04225e693f06f8758a16,5efcb39c12c88f6fa2db5860,DELIVEROO PLUS been paying for something I wasn’t even aware of!,"I have just been looking at my bank statements and noticed that you have been taking money from my account for months on ‘DELIVEROO PLUS.’I have no idea who/when this was supposedly signed up to or how I was tricked into it but I had absolutely zero idea that this was happening. I would never willingly sign up to something like that as I use DELIVEROO about once every two months. I’m pretty disgusted that there is nowhere to tell me I’ve been signed up to this/ a confirmation email etc and that you have been taking my money for god knows how long- at 11.49 a month, something I would NEVER agree with. I would like my money refunded (as I can see you’ve been taking it since at least August) I will not be using this service again. If my money is not refunded I will be taking this further.",2020-10-30 12:16,{1: 'Bad'}
Deliveroo,5f9bf34c5e693f06f8757842,5f9bf347d117ed001ada4563,Awful service - would not recommend,"We ordered Humpit on my birthday and although the food was excellent deliveroo's service was awful. On the day we ordered there was a shortage of drivers. Although we understand that occasionally there are logistical issues, we think it is extremely bad that they do not make you aware of the issue before you place your order. We ended up going to Humpit and collecting the order ourselves as it was over an hour late. If we had known about the issue prior to booking then we would have gone into the restaurant and placed the order there. On top of this, when we contacted deliveroo they said we were 'too late' (more than 2 days) making a complaint so we did not receive any compensation for this. This nearly ruined my birthday because if we hadn't gone to collect it we would have been late for all other activities. Awful service and will not be using again.",2020-10-30 11:04,{1: 'Bad'}
